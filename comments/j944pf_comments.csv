"""Stay off the curbs""
""what was that I can't hear you over the curb rumbling"""
that's about the most panicked i've ever heard a merc engineer sound
"Norris podium, Leclerc redeems the weekend, Hamilton behind Bottas, Vettel spins, Albon is robbed, Gasly did good, 9 retirements without points for Williams. This race is a meme."
"Even in a pandemic, the race director will find fans to show."
"Mercedes: ""Stay off the kerbs please.""

Drivers: ""Haha, car go BRRRRRRRR."""
We are blessed with s🅱️innala in the first race holy fuck
Haha James copypasta'd himself
Zak Brown swaggering up the pit lane like Vince McMahon
"Me: ""Let Albon finish at least 3rd""

God: ""Okay""

Me: ""Wait, not like this"""
11 cars finished. Williams 0 points. Unbelievable
">Race starts

Me: “Yesss, F1 is back!”

>Merc already has a 2+ sec lead

Me: “Yep...F1 is back, all right.”"
"""maybe ferrari can compete finally over a season""

*ferrari fucking die*

""well shit, at least verstappen can fight""

*he retires*

""well at least daniel is pumped and racing vettel and stroll for a bit""

*he fucking retires*


cant have shit in 2020"
Holy fuck a retirement montage HAHA
"oh boy, I can't wait to finally view Formula 1 in full HD without commercials with my new premium F1TV subscription!"
"double merc engine death into Albon, Perez, Norris podium?"
"I’m not an engineer, but I don’t believe the tire is supposed to do that..."
Haas engineers “functioning brakes only slow you down”
"Perez: ṣ̴͌c̸̣͊a̵̤̾ ̶̪̂b̸͇̑l̸̮̉ư̸̯r̴̥͒n̵̲͊d̶̬͝ ̶̯̆b̴͍͛r̵͈̈e̶͇̋l̴̖̎ ̵̗͝b̸̢̊r̸̛̦u̴̹̕m̶̡̓b̷̟͆d̶̝͒ ̸̡͌d̴̞̆u̴͓̓n̵̹̈́?̴̫́  
⠀

Racing Point: Copy that, Checo"
Honestly it's *super* impressive that both Haases had complete brake failures and neither of them are embedded five metres deep into the barriers. Great work from both drivers to save damage.
Albon being sacrificed to the driving gods is the way to great races?
"Ummm Formula 1, we need to talk. Please have a seat. 

You had a four month head start. However, your streaming channel is just like Haas, it doesn’t work. Like wtf F1."
"Fuck F1TV, All my homies hate F1TV"
RTL is unbelievable with their commercials
"Engineers:  please be careful with the car!

Driver:  hehe curbs go brrrrrrrrrr"
"Nicholas Latifi having the best race of his life, from 20th down to 12th. Don't think Williams has even seen a good a race as this in a very long time."
Pretty sure I read that Netflix were with McLaren this weekend
"Mercedes 1 - 2

Ferrari fucking up

Red bull out

F1 is back boys!!"
"Is F1 TV down? I cant get it to load, tried 3 different browsers"
Anyone being fucked with F1TV rn? Page wont load at all.
"Danny Ric retirement

Ah back to normal services fellas"
Sounds like a multi21 in disguise
McLaren gets podium every time HAM hits ALB
Renault engine be like *demonic screeching*
These online lobbies are always crazy.
"Literally ""Drive to Survive"" this race"
"What a clutch ass last lap from Norris!

Atleast something to like about today."
"Amazing performances from Lando and Leclerc.

Was *not* expecting to see Lando pull off that desperate, last gasp banzai lap!

I also didn't expect Leclerc to manage 2nd after that *horrible* qualifying show."
"That was incredible, watching Lando eat into the 7-tenths he needed over the last half lap.

&#x200B;

Also, low-key great race from Leclerc."
FUCK LANDO GET THAT MILK
Just give us an Albon and Lando podium. Pretty please?
Mission spin now
The curbs are lava 👁👄👁
Could we get a tv shot that isn't two Mercs on a Sunday drive? I mean come on theres 14 others cars out there still
If Latifi gets points before Russell........
"With all these dnfs, Latifi could end up being in the points and getting ahead of Russel. That's dark."
This race is a metaphor for 2020
This race is already legendary
Twitch streamer p2 and p3
So both McLaren drivers got their first podiums because of a penalty against Hamilton which he got for hitting Albon . . .
"1. What a fucking massacre 

2. LANDO PODIUM  HYPE!!!!"
HAM vs ALB the new rivarly lol
Lando ahead of Lewis in the championship has been a highlight of this year.
“BOTTAS IS USING MORE CURB THAN ME” 😂😂😂 LITTLE SNITCH
Lando P3 inc don't @ me
"Aaaand I decided to give F1 TV another go this season.

Can't even load the player right now, I assume the website can't handle the traffic. Anybody else having issues? This happened multiple times years ago the first time I tried the service... figured they'd have figured it out by now."
"RIP Verstappen title challenge July 4th, 2020 - July 5th, 2020"
"""Chassis Default 21"" to Bottas sounds suspiciously close to ""Multi 21"""
Kimi’s front right said “aight imma head out”
"“No Kimi, you will not have the wheel.”"
No Kimi that is not the DAS
AR testing their own version of DAS
This race is peak chaos
"Its gonna truly be ""Survive To Drive"""
Lando is so bored that he just liked a tweet during SC
Netflix is the real winner today.
"Nine cars retired.

Hamilton with a five-second penalty.

Bottas-Leclerc-Norris podium.

Holy shit. What a race. This has been a hell of a weekend."
Someone GIF that Lando run to daddy Zak hug!!!!!!
LeC put that shitbox on P2
ALBON DIED SO LANDO COULD LIVE
Albon died for the Lando podium
This is the best advertisement for F1 right now. Drama for the last 15 laps.
McLaren are P2 in CONSTRUCTORS!!!!!!
Let's go LANDO!!!!!!!!! Lando robbing Lewis for his first podium makes this better!
"This race showed what used to be great in F1 - unpredictability, drama, and trying to manage your car from falling apart, not the just the tire temps.

Give me more of that!"
"Norris is fucking amazing, but I am so fucking mad about what happened to Albon, like god damn a second time?"
Today was the first time I tuned in for a live F1 race. Needles to say I’ll be back. Wow. 😂
Norris gets his first podium the SAME way Sainz did
Best moment today : Zak caring for Lando like his own son.!!! Such a wholesome moment..!!
Fuck Albon looks destroyed
Have to pay for F1TV only to need to find an illegal stream. What a POS.
"this is the most generic race

max engine failure

ricciardo engine failure

grosjean fucks up

haas brake breaks

vettel spins"
"Must be amazing to support Mercedes F1. Even when your driver gets a grid penalty, the world conspires to give you a 1-2. Literally impossible to lose, ever."
7 cars out and Vettel still at the same spot lol
So many reliability issues. We were worried drivers were rusty. It was the cars that are fucking rusty
"We see a brake failure, Netflix sees content."
"Kimi is beating Vettel atm.

The last true Ferrari Champ."
"‘Keep off the kerbs Lewis’

Lewis: drives further on the kerbs"
Bottas just clenched up massively hearing James' voice
Big Daddy James has come in and told them both off now
Are we really going to watch only the Mercedes for 23 more laps?
Latifi might score a point and Russell might become an alcoholic if this keeps up.
Ferrari playing 5d chess. Don't need to have a fast car as long as all the others break down *taps head
I guess now Haas was out Alfa had to fulfill the traditional Ferrari-powered-wheel-falling-off in the first race at Austr~~al~~ia
Alpha Romeo DAS system really needs some work.
This was the first ever Grand Prix I've seen. Holy shit I'm absolutely hooked F1 is amazing
I am still so bitter about Albon not winning.
ahhahahah norris bumping the sign
The drive to survive episode for this week is going to be absolutely insane
Lol at people who chose not to watch the race because they expected a 1-2 Merc.
I am gutted for Albon.
That was fucking insane. Thank you based Austrian curbs.
"Yknow what the best part is guys?

WE DO IT ALL AGAIN NEXT WEEK"
Danny Ric to McLaren is looking sooo good!
Leclerc is my dotd. Norris did great but leclerc drove a tractor to 2nd.
Two podiums for Mclaren in 3 races. And both because Lewis took out Albon.
"""I bet you didn't expect that.""

""I didn't expect that either.""

Charles please."
A Lando podium almost makes up for not getting an Albon win
Netflix was recording McLaren and Red Bull this week. Gonna be nice!
Albon needs to start social distancing himself from Hamilton
Love how nobody's giving a shit about Bottas winning lmao
"Fantastic race. 

Charles pulling out a P2 after looking like he wasn't going to be able to get past Lando and Perez was completely unexpected.

Hamilton making multiple uncharacteristic mistakes and dropping to fourth was completely unexpected.

Lando ripping out a fastest lap to squeak out a podium was awesome. Including the high risk move on Perez.

Notable:
It took 5 people ahead of him to retire for Vettel to make the points. (Verstappen/Stroll/Ricciardo/Raikkonen/Albon. Towards the end of the race he got passed by Giovinazzi. Absolutely brutal performance.

Felt for Albon. Hamilton screwed him again, but his car gave up the ghost regardless.

9 Retirements!"
"""What about Albon's podium?""

*Gone. Reduced to atoms*"
Lol Lando waterboarded himself and very quietly realised and took his mask off.
 Lando with the bottle spike like a pro! So happy for the kid!
"My whole family is asleep, it’s me and my cat jumping around celebrating in the living room alone lmao"

Hands down the most exciting finish of a Formula 1 race in the last 7 months
This is the most blursed race that has ever happened in F1
It's nice to see two midfield teams on the podium.
Leclerc saves Ferrari reputation Norris takes podium and fastest lap and Bottas 3.0 is on fire!
Lando water boarding fools out here
God I feel awful for Alex. Fuck man.

Who'd have though Ferrari would finish P2?
Damn if this race went 5 laps longer I'm pretty sure something else would have happened and Latifi would have gotten a point lmao
Haven't been that excited for the ending of a race for the past 3 years. What a banger of an ending.
Mclaren for the second time gets a third place because of a hamilton's penality due to an incident with albon. That's pretty prophetic

Lmao if both Mercs would have to retire that would make this first GP weekend absolutly perfect as full on chaos weekend.
Prediction: Merc cars will be allowed back on the curbs now that they don't have a 10 second lead and neither car will break
At this rate latifi is going to end on the points
Less reliable cars makes F1 so much more fun.
k this race really is 2020
"Hamilton fucks over Albon. Gets penalized. McLaren promoted to podium.


I've seen this movie before"
McLaren's good luck charm is Ham hitting Albon apparently.
"Leclerc P2 and Norris P3, just how?

Feel bad for Albon

Most chaotic dry race in a long time"
"What a fucking random race, loved it"
Cannot believe how the hell I see Charles on 2nd place. Good race!
I hadn't watched an F1 race in probably 15 years and boy did that not disappoint.
Man I really want a Rolex all of a sudden
"After seeing what Charles did today, im convinced hes a future WDC. My goodness me how did he dragged that red trashcan to 2nd? I dont know but I enjoyed it!"

F1 IS BACK WOOO"
"Now lets do a what if.

What if Ham and Bot both have engine failures.

Podium: Albon, Perez, Norris."
We might actually see Steiner's head explode in season three
This is not the entertainment that I imagined would be the first race of this season
I'm going to scream if Latifi gets a point before George
Albon just got robbed
They should really let Albon take the position from Perez.
"How was Perez allowed to go back since safety light was turned on?
Since Albon had overtaken already, shouldn't he still be 3?"
Pure chaos of today lets me forget about the horrible season Ferrari is going to have thanks F1!

This race is the most 2020 thing ever
"Lewis off the podium

Ferrari 2nd

LANDO on the podium

"Fuckers, the mask needs to go over your nose."
didn't Lando also get the fastest lap
"BOT killed it today, not a step wrong the whole time. I know it’s too early to judge but I really would love to see him keep the fight up with HAM this year."
Gutted for Albon. Stoked for Landon. Bottas looks like he can make this season his bitch.
You feel sorry for Lewis? What about Albon?
"What a race!! I was on the edge of my seat the whole time! It feels good to have F1 back! I hope we can get more races as the season progresses. Please, Universe. 

Really dominant for Bottas. I hope he can continue with this form for the rest of the season. I want him to get this championship, for once. 

Absolutely monstrous race from Leclerc, in a seemingly impossible to get to 5th with Shitbox of an ""extreme concepts"" car. He is really convincing me that Ferrari invested in the right guy. 

Absolutely gutted for Albon. He deserved that podium. I don't think Hamilton really had much to correct that in the spur of the moment, but he got what he deserved. He will bounce back for sure."
"CTRL + ALT + DEL, thanks Martin"
Max and daniel both out just like the old times

THE DIRECTOR WILL FIND YOU!

Kimi you will not have the wheel
That should be Albons position
Perez should give the place back to Albon

In Memoriam montage lol
"this is my favorite season opener in *years* just due to the sheer quantity of weird shit that's happened in its context

"HAMILTON PENALTY, LECLERC WILL GET 2ND

OH MY FUCK THIS RACE"
NORRIS 3RD YAAAAAAAA
LANDO PODIUM GET IN BOYS
Lando *FUCK YOUR P3 SIGN* Norris
This truly is the dankest f1 timeline
GET IN LANDOOOOO!!!
Lnado hitting the sign hahaahahahha so happy for him
"Norris not driver of the day...

Why? Because you can only vote during the race and not afterwards. Dumb system."
Norris with the lap of his life chasing Hamilton for the podium.
Imo this race showed the talent of leclerc and lando more than any other. Leclerc dragged that car up and lando had to pull out a gem of a couple laps to get the podium. Champ mentality from lando
Sad for Albon but happy for Lando
"**LET US NOT FORGET**

#ALMOST HALF THE FIELD DIDN'T FINISH"
The Great Ferrari Master Plan is working
"Congrats mercedes on the championship, see you next season"
Watched the F1 series on Netflix and was really impressed. This is the first ever F1 race I've seen live and not gonna lie... this is a blast
watch lando get a podium boys
"F1TV is broken, I can't even get the webpage to load"
So the penalty for Hamilton means that we get 5 mins of a competitive season instead of just the run to the first corner?
F1 TV is dead as usual
Fuck f1tv not working again I need stream links quick
Are F1TV servers hosted by Ferrari?
"""Albon we need you to come to put road, Max needs your car"""

YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS SHIT UP
"Mercedes fighting on track, so we get a lingering shot of Toto followed by an empty track. Directing masterclass."
"Neither one is ""staying off the kerbs"", apparently"
Valterri it’s James...
PLZ double retirement
"Mercedes is doing that thing again where they conjure up some kind of ""critical"" issue because they're bored and act like they're doing us a favor in the process by making things exciting or whatever."
"Kimi thinking to himself ""I wish I had my boat."""
What the hell is this race? Everyone is dropping like flies!
Kimi probably had some flashbacks to McLaren years
"Albon should be 3rd, had the place when the SC came out"
6 of the 10 teams have had at least 1 car retire.
Netflix team is gleeful
At this point Haas should check if they really have Brembo or some knockoff Brambu they found in a nearby mechanic shop who promised 'best quality'.
If Lewis complains about the tires over radio then he will magically find all the grip of a set of new softs
i think for Albon lewis is the real torpedo
Ferrari outscoring Red Bull through sheer luck.
If Leclerc actually ends up on the podium with the 5th slowest car...
Norris on the podium!!!!!
LAAAANDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Well that was unpredictable chaos. Loved it. Welcome back F1.
LETS FUCKING GOOO NORRISS!!!
Classic Lando. Drives into the #3 marker.
Lando drove that last lap like Han Solo.
A shame Lando's first podium is without a crowd. He would've loved their reaction!
Can we have 6 more Austria if the race outside Europe isn't happening?
lando x zak hug is the purest thing I've ever seen
Can someone get a gif of lando doing that run to Zak ?

"Unpopular Opinion, Raise The Curb Height, Need More Action Like This Race"
Fucking ESPN cut to a milf way to early
Vettel didn’t do himself a favour today.. to be honest Mercedes doesn’t need him. Vettel proved that he isn’t the driver he used to be and Bottas did exactly what he needed to do. Mercedes would be stupid to throw out Bottas and sign Vettel
"Merc 1-2.
VET spin.

F1 is back"
"Jep, F1tv failing.."
How do we still have such issues with f1 tv....

Both mercs to break their cars in trying to beat each other. Honestly I’d be so down for that
"Come on guys, keep racing each other for first and break those cars on the curbs"
Safety car is a fucking MVP today. This is gonna be good!
The director actually found a way to cut to the crowds.
At this rate Latifi is going to get a point for his Sunday driving.
"God bless F1 for trying to give Netflix half a season's worth of content for a single race, this is excellent."
Imagine if Latifi bags a point before Russell
o/u the safety car leads more laps this year than ferrari?
Latifi is close to the points. No one saw that coming.
Brilliant. Albon back in. Get in.
"Hamilton got a penalty for it last time, deserves it again here"
HAMILTON PENALTY
"This race lol.

Go Max! Nope

Go Alex! Nope

Go Lando! Nope

Lando with fastest lap holy shit
"Lando, you fucking legend. FUCKING LEGEND. Dude just put a fastest 2nd sector on the last lap."
YES LANDO LETS FUCKING GO SON
HOLY SHIT WHAT A CLUTCH FASTEST LAP
I need a gif of Lando ramming the 3rd place marker
"Started boring, but damn it was worth it"
And P2 for Ferrari. Just like we all expected.
Lando grew his pubes today
CONFIRMED: STREAMING RACING MAKES YOU BETTER
Who would have thought you'd be seeing a Ferrari in P2
I'm glad Bottas got to keep his true 1st place. He deserved to lead the whole thing.

New fan here - that was the greatest thing I’ve ever seen holy shit! Is formula one usually this entertaining?
Leclerc is the real deal. Put a bag full of fighting Italians on his back and got marching.
How the FUCK did LeClerc put that Ferrari in 2nd????????
How the heck did ferrari end on that podium.
Twitch stream from the podium?
Ok I’m still waiting. Need that gif of Lando and daddy Zak hug!
We need to make a petition for Sky to show more of the planes in their pre race shows. They always cut away from the air displays :(
Signed up to F1 TV - doesn't work. Great.
13 cars left and Vettel still not in the points. Oof

Yoooo where tf has Leclerc come from 🤣
Figuring out who's on the podium feels like one of those early math problems lol

So happy for Norris! What a stonking lap
LANDOOOOOO

alex died for this again
I am shocked that Ferrari ended that in 2nd. Well managed from LeClerc

"I've gone through so much pain supporting McLaren over the past decade or so.

And then the red bull ring pulls off it's mask and reveals itself as Baku the whole time
The could-have-beens hurt the most. Sorry Alex! Sorry Russell!
Can’t wait for the face mask champagne waterboarding
LANDOOOOOOO!!!!
god bless espn for clearing f1tv's high bar of... showing literally *any* footage?
f1tv is not loading for others? Just get a black screen when selecting Austria Race :(.
"F1TV.. bought it, doesn't work. What a waste of money."
Is f1tv failing to work for anyone else?
Why am I even paying for F1TV if I'm only watching the pirated streams anyway because it never fucking works?
Fuck. Imagine waiting 9 months to go out after 12 laps for a failure. Fucks sake
great fuckin start of the season :/
Well Albon has two extra front wings available now.
Fucking monkeys paw. We get F1 back. Verstappen out almost immediately.
FUCK. Thank fucking god Daniel is going to MCL next year. I’m so tired of the fucking engine issues
Good on Norris to hold his place.
SPINALLLA
S🅱️INALLA
Vettel did it againn omggg
You can’t make this up
"As much as we were all up in arms about the HALO way back when, the graphics that SKY has made for it look REALLY fucking COOL!"
Chassis Default 2-1 = Multi 2-1??
Do we think “Chassis Default 2-1” might be the Mercedes version of Multi 21?
"Why is it always plan A or plan B. Just once I want to hear an engineer say “Vettel, go to plan M”"
I kinda hope they wreck each other. Been a while since we've seen that.
Lewis snitching on bottas using more kerbs xD
“Even badder”
James sounds worried.
Do I have to pay extra to see other cars?
"Alex, pls, go nuts on the restart, else it'll be a Merc 1-2-3"
The got a fucking front loader up there rofl
I need a clip of that tire absolutely cruising across the screen
Kimi bout to go join those guys on the hill I bet
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED
How is albon not getting 3rd?
Bwoah my wheel fell off
At this point the podium is going to be whatever 3 cars actually manage to make it to the end.
Kimi: “Okay this isn’t fun anymore.”
"They say the drivers might be rusty after a long break, i think it's the cars they'd have to worry about, not the drivers."
This race has been amazing for all the wrong reasons I love it
"You know what, there is something peculiar about doing a race two times at the same track. I wonder what next weekend will look like and if the same DNFs will happen"
Albon decides he wants the place back
I think I have PTSD
"I am counting for Norris for podium

Edit. Lando Norris finishes third with the fastest lap"
Lmao Ferrari 2nd. Who woulda thunk
It’s like watching a racing sim where half the drivers just go in the “whatever” mode.
LANDO FUCKING NORRIS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
Landooooooo!!
If Albon couldn’t get it I’m happy it was Lando
Hamilton spins Albon. Mclaren podium. I’ve seen this one before.
"Amazing result for Mclaren 
Nobody expected for ferrari to get a podium"
LANDOOO
McLarens poduims come off a Hamilton penaltynafter contact with Albon. You can’t make this up
Norris hits the 3
"As a new fan from Netflix

The race is so much more fucking exciting than the drama from Netflix

This sport is awesome"
that Ferrari shitbox at P2 is the absolute cherry.
The range of emotions from Max's retirement to Lando's fast last lap was nutsss
There was so much happening in the final lap that I didn't even realize the race ended!
Yoooo Lando!!!!!!! The meme-iest finish for such a meme race
I'm more amazed Ferrari got a podium than I am McLaren after their effort the last few days.
"What a gloriously absurd opening to the season. All those in favor of holding more than two races in Austria, say aye."
"What a fucking shit show

I love it"
"Unreal power move by Bottas not letting Hamilton past at the end. 

Great!"
"First drink, then spray. Glad they are wearing masks!"
Need an onboard of Lando’s last lap
Just want to mention that Vettel is currently struggeling to pass Russel...
We have 7 retirements and Vettel still isn't in the points
Anyone else getting error codes with F1TV at the moment?
Why did I even expect F1TV to work
IS anyone else having trouble with F1TV? When i try to load the live race it just stays on a white screen
ahh crofty struggling to keep up with how fast the starting grid graphics move...i've missed this. it's the little things
F1TV is a fucking joke.
"Wow, another WCC for Mercedes."
What a shame that both Ferraris will be chasing the wrong coloured Mercedes this year.
When Illegal streams are more stable than f1tv
Albon could get his first podium out of that
LANDO WE ARE NOW DEPENDING ON YOU
Max is going to kill someone.
"Daniel is definitely thinking ""bring on next year"""
"In the end it’ll just be Ferrari engines alive, ironic."
"My drive to the library this afternoon was
More exciting than this"
"Ah yes, I’d forgotten what the 2014 season was like."
OMG that was absolutely beautiful coordination. Poetry in motion for the Mercedes pit crew
Gotta love the pit lane chaos every time an SC happens.
That double stop was beautiful. Mercedes are just ruthless.
That yellow means slow down Lewis.. 😉
haha kerbs go brrrrrrr
Fuck me here come the memes.
VETTEL DID THE THING
"Obligatory 360 spin, another one for the bingo card"
Now F1 is back lmao
Is it just me or is the Merc safety car the best sounding car out there??
Still 35 laps to go and Merc are talking about turning the engines down wtf
"Seb spins, Danny Ric breaks down, grosjean spins, magnussen causes a safety car, Mercedes double stack and Mercedes 1-2
This is the hybrid era greatest hits race."
That mirror in the halo is AMAZING
HANG ON? How is God tier driver Russell up in 12? Someone get the cameras on him!
[deleted]
"> Leclerc is the meat in a McLaren sandwich

seriously, they're writing this themselves"
"2019 - Mercedes 1-2 no fight, Midfield battle raging

Race Director - Shows Mercs


2020 - Mercedes actually fighting for 1-2

Race Director - LOOK AT OUR NEW HALO GRAPHIC"
Bottas radio - Sensor issues seen on both cars. Please stay off the kerbs
If Lewis could take both Mercs out for the Albon win that'd make today worth it lol
"""Dad it's Bottas not me"""
"A FERRARI CAN’T CATCH A WILLIAMS 

WHAT IS HAPPENING"
There is no racing happening anywhere.
The curbs are more competitive than Ferrari’s car
James is doing radio on both lol
CRITICAL
T H I S I S J A M E S
There's 14 other cars and we're watching laps on avoiding curbs.
Curbs DOTD
"Vettel can't catch Russel... that is new low...

Nothing against Russel, but you get my point..."
Netflix producer mouths are watering atm
ALBON IT'S GODDAMN TIME FOR BRAZIL VENGEANCE
Come on give me a Toto fist slam
That tire said ✌🏽
Holy shit it just came off lmao
albon should be p3...
Fucking imagine if Latifi shithouses some points here
The front fell off…
Gasly quietly having a good race
"That’s not very typical, I’d like to make that point."
What the actual fuck is going on in this race
Latifi is seriously gonna end up in the points by fucking around on a nice Sunday drive
The scenes if Latifi gets points before Russell
Alfa deploying zero axis steering
F1: Battle Royale
WOW 2 FERRARIS MIGHT ACTUALLY GET POINTS?
Now imagine this race but with rain next weekend
Albon p3 again
Albon took back 3rd
"That is Albon's place tho, he's in the right."
Now only if norris overtakes Perez...
NOOOOOOOO BRAZIL 2019 FLASHBACKS 😭😭😭
I can't help but laugh at this. How the fuck did it happen again?!
Dude wtf Hamilton
"What a move from Leclerc, amazing"
Holy shit Ferrari is getting p2 after a terrible weekend
LANDO UNDER 5 SEC
Lmao this race
What a shitshow but all is good bc Norris on the podium
ALEX TOOK ONE FOR THE MOTHERFUCKING TEAM!!!!
LAAAAAAAANNNNNNDDDDDDOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!
Awww just realized that Norris first podium wont be a real podium ceremony :(
Latifi in 11th in his FIRST EVER RACE. IN A WILLIAMS
We'll be rewatching this race the next pandemic
Lmao smashing that 3rd cone
A Lando podium? Memes are going to be so 🔥🔥🔥 this week.
A happy Zak brown makes me happy :)
Lando not knowing how to park at the podium.
Alex is McLaren's sacrificial lamb
Give us a replay of this race next week! But with different retirements plz
I don't think anyone would predict this. What a crazy race.
10 second post race time penalty for Bottas for taking his mask off.
[deleted]
"It's a scandal that F1TV is not working, utter shit..."
"Crazy that just 1 DNF kills the whole race. Mercedes 1-2, we're back at it again boys"
"THIS IS AMAZING. THEYRE GOING TO ACTUALLY BLOW UP THEIR CARS

ENGINEERS SCREAMING."
I think the cars have Covid-19.
Let's give props to Leclerc for dragging that dogshit Ferrari up into 2nd place
"espn cutting off already wtf, is this what americans have to deal with"
"When you drive a potato but still make it to the podium, well done mr Banana."
"That was a great show of solidarity. Even the ones who didn’t kneel were still there supporting the ones who did. And they did it before the anthem played. Just a peaceful, respectful demonstration. 

Nobody should have a problem with that."
Really don‘t understand how F1TV is still such a pain in the ass in its 3rd year
"F1 TV not working
Again"
Anyone else have troubles with F1TV? Honestly still dont know why I keep paying for it
No fans to cut to and the director is still missing overtakes.
"Bottas so far ahead, he's already starting next weekend's race"
I’m all for social distancing but this is getting outta hand Bottas
They're about to take Alex out of the car and give it to Max
Lewis WDC in the bag
This is why he’s leaving you boys
"Horner said the drivers would be rusty. nope, turns out it's the cars that are rusty."
"So that's 1 Honda engine with a problem, 1 Renault one, 1 Mercedes one, and 6 Ferrari ones showed up this year with problems."
"""I just wish we had racing back""

***finger on monkey's paw curls**"
He just yeeted himself straight into the garage omg
"We waited 220+ days to see the same cars in front, the same cars retiring, the same Haas spinning and the same Ferraris fucking up as usual. Amazing."
That Renault engine sound… wtf.  Horror movie stuff.  Like a power tool killer.
Mercedes man... how long this shit is gonna last? It's like watching Bundesliga or Serie A every year.
I think the God of Race decided award this race to Mercedes.
Could the Mercedes maybe... collide... and let Albon through?
What was Vettel doing lol
Vettel really gives no Fk now lol
Why does the Ferrari sound like the exhaust is made out of a tin can?
"At least Vettel is helping give Sainz some TV time, nice guy"
Can we show racing instead of the Mercs doing hot laps please?
"""urgent chassis default 2 1"" is the exact same thing as multi 21, right?"
STAY ON THE CURBS LEWIS
"Well all the ""2020 is a two man season between the Mercedes drivers"" hot takes were... completely spot on."
Why is it so hard to hear team radio? Feel like the audio quality is worse than years prior
Daddy James stepping in to discipline his children.
Vettel about to give us the great Ferrari on Williams action we were all anticipating
"Both merc retire, Albon takes the win.... xD"
"Could they maybe show some of the race?

Or are we stuck watching both Mercs just coasting freely?

Where the hell is the midfield?????"
"Mercedes ""STAY OFF THE KERBS IT'S DAMAGING THE CAR""

Bottas and Lewis ""No you can't make us""

Mercedes ""You've dun goofed the cars well done"""
Haas should just become a full on Netflix show tbh
"George finally paying back Alex for the lawn mower incident, all is forgiven."
"Some great social distancing there, folks."
"WAS KALM.

TIME TO PANIK."
Sky really seem to love their Zoom chats with Christian Horner.
George sacrificed himself for our entertainment boys
Who the fuck brought that truck all the way up the mountain?
Next week the entire hill fill be full of people
Nice noise from the safety car being picked up on the trackside mics.
max punching the air rn
WHAT IN THE WORLD?!
"Need a gif of Kimi's tire doing the old ""I must go my people need me"""
The front fell off
Perez should give the place back
"Jesus, anyone else think that the kerbs at austria are becoming a safety issue?"
"If Hamilton got a penalty for not reacting quick enough, Perez needs to hand that position back."
The stewards better hurry up and sort out the Albon P3 or P4 thing quickly. None of this shite where they say he should've been P3 after the race
AUSTRIA aka WELCOME TO THE THUNDERDOME
2020 is a wild fucking year
One more and vettel has a point
It's good to see F1 respecting proper social distancing by having everyone finish on different laps.
"Mercedes:

> “NOW DO YOU TWO SEE WHY YOU HAVE TO STAY OF THE CURB!!!!???  THE TIRES ARE LITERALLY FALLING OFF THE CARS.”"
Verstappen looking like dude wanted to power car through head movement.
going to need a black and white cut of the retirements set to sara mclachlan
Jesus what is this race lmao
This race is a comedy of errors lol.
The great losers of this weekend are the engineers.
Looks like they gave Albon the position back.
"Why does this safety car take do fucking long, Kimi's car is long gone"
Don’t bottle this Alex
At this point I just hope those merc engines nope the fuck out of there. Dammit
"Absolute bullshit, Lewis didn't give him the room on that turn."
"Leclerc like ""heard y'all were talking shit"""
This is fucking hectic
"My first full F1 race and my god, I’ve been spoiled. Is there this much drama in other races?"
NORRISSSSS
LANDO ON THE PODIUM
Lando podium saves the day after my Albon sadness
Lando! Did it on the last lap!
LANDOOOO
What a fucking race. I'm mentally exhausted now
Who's more happy Zak or Lando
Somehow Leclerc dragged that shitbox to P2
"Yes, Lando, another McLaren podium, back to back and now real one! :)"
LANDO SCREAMING LIKE CRAZY
I need a lie down
GET IN LANDOOOOOOOOOO
The really unexpected part is for sure the P2 for Ferrari
YENSON MY FRIEND
#LANDOOOOOOO
LANDO LANDO LANDO LANDO LANDO!!!!!!!!!!!!
Around lap 20 i was going to stop watching.... man i am glad i watched the whole thing.
"WHAT. A. BANGER.

Absolutely excellent stuff here, only thing missing was Latifi getting a point."
"What I expected least was a Ferrari on the podium, what a random race my god"
"Unless you have a DeLorean, there is no way anyone bet on this podium"
I’m sad lando’s missing out on the crowd going wild right now
This podium on the track is depressing
Socially distant champagne I’m dead
Is this the first brit to be on the podium other than Hamilton since Jenson?
Quality Champange > covid19! Go valtter!
"Leclerc dragged that shitbox to 2nd. 

What a lad"
"I’m still kinda new around here, but if like me F1TV crapped out on you, ESPN is working well."
"Norris got passed by a RBR and a Mercedes. In other words, cars that were known to be much faster than his. 

Let's see how he stacks up against the midfield"
That Ferrari engine sounds kinda weird.
So the season was fun for 10 laps?
Max tried to load F1TV
Martin Brundell: Just Ctrl Alt Delete it Max
/r/techsupportgore
Holy shit VET making no progress on an unwell STR
Is Vettel struggling to overtake Stroll with engine problems?
"Another race, another engine problem for Ricciardo. His relationship with Renault is cursed at this point"
"Imagine if it turns out that the Ferrari engine is absolutely bulletproof, and they do well purely because everyone else's start failing."
"3 early mechanical retirements from 3 different teams, and 3 different power units. Wow."
Oh Grosjean. Forgot about you back there
Everyone racing on Formula 1 and Mercedes is already on Formula 0.75
That Renault sounds absolutely horrible
Mercedes stacking is such a great flex lol
Mercedes double stack is a thing of beauty
[deleted]
"Sucks for Kimi, pit exactly at the wrong time and lost out in the sc"
Sergio planning a masterclass in tyre preservation?
"Poor Magnussen. He was doing pretty OK this race.

He'll be taking to the sea this week for sure."
"Merc to pull a 2016, Albon, Norris & Perez on the Podium and I'll get a tattoo of it"
AND HERE COMES THE S🅱️INALLA.
S🅱️inalla
110% Vettel's fault
Vettel and spinning
Bloody hell. That was messy from Seb.
NETFLIX THIS WRITING IS GETTING CLICHED NOW
Vettel's frustration gets the better of him.
General Spinobi!
the memes write themselves
Can Russell get that Williams into the Top 10??
Fórmula dank going wild.
“Of all the people whom he (Vettel) could’ve tangled with.. it’s the man who’s replacing him next year.” Brutal.
Imagine being so comfortable you can afford to turn down your engines
"Less than halfway through race one, and Merc are turning the engine down. Jesus."
Halo graphics are on point this year
Race director took our feedback to show the midfield too seriously
I haven't seen a Ferrari struggle to catch a Mclaren since 2012.
Seeing kimi and vettel a names next to each other makes me miss 208
Man if only both the Mercedes went off while fighting. Would make the season very exciting.
I just want Alex on the podium and Russell to get a point
ALB - PER - NOR on the podium. Let's go!
"But Totoooooooo he's using more curbs than me 😭

(Throws me back to Alonso moaning about Vettel's track limits in Silverstone 2014)"
"Mercedes: Lewis, back off or we'll shut your sensors off ourselves"
YES CRITICAL LETS GO SENSORS
IF ONLY VERSTAPPEN DIDN'T RETIRE :(
ALBON FIRST WIN? PauseChamp
"James, it’s Valterri, fuck your kerbs"
"Both Mercedes break, Albon Checo Lando podium, who complains?"
"The word of today is ""CURB"" brought to you by the letter C and Martin Brundle"
"They both ride the curbs. Toto should retire them as a punishment. 

pls"
"This is very disappointing, both mercs are pussyfooting around at the front and are still untouchable."
God an Albon Perez Norris podium would be beautiful
When was the last time they showed a non Mercedes on screen?!!!
Show ANY other car. Please. Fucking ridiculous this.
"Everyone before the race: ""Reliability is very important, it's crucial to avoid DNFs this short season""

Race: 💥"
"Jesus Christ, they're dropping like flies!"
Wait albon might be getting his first podium today holy shit
At this pace every driver is going to retire with mechanical issues.
Latifi will outlast everyone by being so far back and end up 1st
Albon wins this
LETS FUCKING GO ALBON
Albono please make things interesting
"Those red tyres are turning me on, come on Albon"
People on the hill a whole vibe
"I need Albon to win this. Destroy the Mercedes, come on!"
"If Latifi finishes in the points, I'll eat a steak dinner."
つ ◕_◕ ༽つ ALBON TAKE MY ENERGY ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
Whats going on in this race?? Holy cow
Everyone in the points
Holy shit the tire just bounced right off lmao. That could have been so bad
Well this is certainly one way to keep racing close. Constant safety cars so they never have a chance to build gaps.
Surely Albon was ahead there....
At this rate Latifi is going to get his first points on debut haha
Vettel almost back in the points!
"Coming right out of safety car just to slow down to another one, I'm dying of laughter this race is awesome so far"
Wait why does Albon have to give that place back?
Why the fuck is Perez holding that spot.
It's as if COVID-19 is affecting the cars today.
Albon got robbed dude
"As a new fan, reading these comments, you’re telling me this is not normal right?"
Lol @ the graphics freaking out because all of the cars are going through the pits.
It's as if the cars are suffering from a pandemic of their own. 35% mortality rate.
DOTD: safety car
Such an eventful race!!!! But not the events we wanted ......
They just going to let the Perez yellow overtake stand? Wtf
"I’ve missed this. I’ve missed the racing, the community and the memes. This is awesome!"
"Both Mercedes retire and we get an Albon, Perez, and Norris podium to start the year please."
No Kimi you will not have the tire
FUCK NOT AGAIN
NOT AGAIN
"again, i feel sad for alex wtf."
I was so happy for a split second there
red bull garage is my exact reaction
"Crofty, the Sainz's real name is ""Lando Norris"" 🤦🏽‍♂️"
Hahaha the worst weekend of Ferrari in history will end with a 2nd place
"Repeat Brazil.. Hamilton knocking Albon in a spin and off podium, but still getting more points"
Norris come 3rd
"I like Albon a lot, but he really needs to knock off his pre-race routine of smashing a mirror under a ladder."
Stewards have hired Oprah confirmed
What a shit show I love it
LANDO NORRIS!!!! Who had him on their bingo card today?
what an insane race
"Norris fastest lap and on the podium, incredible!"
Latifi earning what will likely be his highest ever finish
Sainz is right behhind Norris too after starting way lower and worse luck. Very impressive
FORMULA 1 IS BACK BABY!!!
YEEEEES LANDO!!!!
LANDO!!!!
Why were we not watching Lando in the final lap!!! What a great performance to take on that podium opportunity. And I'm surprised Lewis let it happen.
My boi Norris!
FASTEST LAP FUCK YEYEYEYSYSSSSS!!!!
My first time watching a full race.  Good shit!  That was fun.
Leclerc did an amazing job too
"What a lap from Norris, absolutely incredible"
Zak striding down pitlane like a boss.
Holy fuck Lando!
Zak Brown basically doing the Vince McMahon strut up the pit lane
Lmao Lando bonking the podium number
That race started off so disappointing and ended so amazingly! Same time next week!
"This race deserved a crowd in attendance, so crazy."
As a redbull fan that was less than ideal mate. Happy for lando tho.
Leclerc very impressive in coming 2nd in what is not a very fast car tbh
LANDOOOOOOOOOOOO
Feel good for Norris and McLaren. Lewis did cause the accident.
Almost looked like bottas tried to back up hamilton last lap
Seeing three different cars on the podium is awesome
Norris P3 is much better than Hamilton P2 and Albon P3
"What a fucking race! 

also, all that meme material: vettel spins, hamilton makes albon spin on his way to the podium, our meme boi gets a podium. If only latifi had gotten a point, we'd have the george russel is the best williams driver but loses on points. Still probably going to be williams' better result of the season. What a race!"
And how about Charles dragging that dog of a Ferrari to P2
Hoping to see the Lando-style champagne-popping podium celebration !!!
battling off sainz a few laps earlier to taking Perez and sticking in the fastest lap on the last lap to beat Lewis. Phenomenal driving.
"To my fellow McLaren fans, remember the though years we had in 17-18 and look at us now!!"
McLaren not allowed regular podiums
"Goddamit, ESPN. Why would you cut away already?"
see you in austria guys!! this sounds so weird.
Such a fuck fight of a race but goddamn id be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it #reliabilityera
Fuck ESPN I screamed at the television
Horner telling it like it is
"What a shame for Perez but the car looks good, he will probably have a good race next weekend too. Vettel wow, bareky in the points after all the retirements."
"""Lewis stay off the kerbs"" 

Lewis: ""haha kerb go BRRRRR"""
F1 tv ded already?
"Dread it, run from it, Mercedes 1-2 arrives all the same"
Verstappen DNF is terrible for this season.
"Ricc and Max out on mechanical issues.

Feels almost nostalgic."
"Oi, McLaren mechanic! Mask over the nostrils!!"
7 retirements and Vettel still not in the points
Five seconds seems seriously unfair after absolutely ruining Albon's race. Not pleased with that.
LANDO YOU FUCKING DON WHAT A FUCKING LAP THAT WAS
Leclerc pulled that shitbox to P2 amazing
Charles drove the wheels off that car. He’s going to have a long career
Seeing Zak Brown happy makes me happy.
Does F1TV work for anyone? I always get errors across all platforms and browsers!!
"F1TV already down, when will they learn..."
"F1TV is not working again? Just getting white pages, can someone pm me a stream maybe I don't want to miss the start :("
"Okay Lando, remember the formation lap this time"
"To anyone using the shit service that is F1TV and are stuck on initializing, click on any of the driver feeds then back to the 'live' button (right side of the screen). Started the stream for me."
At this rate F1 TV should just be free 😐
How is F1TV so bad? I guess its illegal streams then.
It's weird that the all-black Mercedes immediately feels right.
Now the merc from Lewis is smoking too!
"Russell P19, business as usual here"
"This season will be a good preparation for not having Seb on the grid, because with this car he may as well not be"
"9 laps in and Leclerc has made up no positions, Vettel has made up 1. They truly built a shitbox"
15 laps before Crofty starts giving Happy Birthday shoutouts to his IRL friends.
Horner: it's all Renault's fault
"Change to Mode F Max, I repeat Mode F"
"Let Bottas win please, don't fuck it for him with team orders."
Max is the only one who could challenge Lewis and start with a DNF.
C'mon Sebastian do something or just park the car and kick Mattia in his balls
"The ferrari can't even overtake racing point with engine issues yikes, even with softs on"
Lol a Ferrari can't overtake a Mercedes powered car experiencing issues. Peak Ferrari Fml
"At this rate, Williams will get points based on engine failures."
"Pre-season ""I wish there was more mechanical DNFs just like the old days""

2020 begins

""No not THOSE DNFs, other ones!"""
Ricciardo should just drive back to the McLaren garage and declare asylum
"Everyone will retire, so Ferrari playing 4D chess here, engine's so shit that can't overheat."
Ferrari could shithouse a decent result out of this
These cars got COVID
Haas pitstop - did it all go well? Are the tyres attached?
So many cars dropping George might even get his first point.
[removed]
"So it looks like:

Mercedes

(enormous gap)

Red Bull

(smaller gap)

McLaren/RP/Ferrari"
Drivers who have retired from the race should go sit in the grandstand together
That Renault Engine looks fucked
In before the safety car retires with an engine issue.
Flawless Mercedes double stack as usual
textbook unsafe release
I’m guessing Renault is powered by the screaming of a thousand souls being violated by baguettes.
"Mercedes agent Ocon deployed an emp while overtaking the Haas. Perfect timing for a safety car, free pitstop and double stack for Mercedes. /s"
"Haas paid for the full track, so they gon' use the full track"
That was a dope move by Magnussen to keep his car out of the gravel and stop relatively safely.
Well at least if Albons on the podium it's redemption from what happened in Brazil last year.
"RB, McLaren and Ferrari fighting for the same position. We're back in 2010 Bois."
Is it just me or Botass's front right tyre looking a bit scary
Of fucking course
Oh my God you can't write this
FOR FUCKS SAKE MUSS DAS SEIN
"\*I am the Ferrari driver now\*

Carlos Sainz Jr, probably"
THERE WE GO BOYS THERE WE GO
There was no way for Vettel to get through there lmao. The man doesnt give a fuck.
"He got it out of his system on the first one, no more spinning from now"
"George lookin tasty up in 12th. With this reliability throughout the field, points seem possible"
lol Merc turning engines down and still whipping ass
Dont u date rob us from Merc vs Merc racing down the stretch
"Grosjean defeating physics and bypassing track limits. 

Absolute legends. 

Even the black and whites cannot stop his power."
Merc better not team order this. It's the battle for the lead
Man they have to put this halo graphic with the reverse camera in the F1 game
absolutely love the halo overlay graphic.
That Renault sounds like a carpet cleaner
"Can we not switch to Ferrari onboards? The engine sounds sick, not in the good way"
"Almost forgot about Alpha Tauri, they haven't shown their onboard a single time so far"
I just want Russel to nab a point finally
We should rename F1.5 to F1.1. Everyone except Mercedes.
As if the Mercedes domination isn't bad enough. AT LEAST FUCKING RACE
In before mercs stall and albon gets his 1st win
[deleted]
Bono my sensors are gone
Nice of Seb to go race with Kimi again
"Is anything happening except this Mercedes fight?  Who knows, they haven’t talked about the rest of the field in 10 minutes"
Show the midfield ffs
"Ferrari legit being in F1.5.

Seb is screwed from that mistake he made."
"Merc: ""stAy oFf tHe KeRbs""

Hamilton and Bottas: ""fk it"""
"Seriously and the worst part Mercedes is sandbagging it. On the safe side. All credit to
Them. But this is so damn boring."
"Mercedes garage: ""Stay off the kerbs.""

Lewis: ""No...no, I don't think I will."""
ITS JAMES
JAMES
Can the race director PLEASE show the midfield ugh
"Critical, stay off the fuckin kerbs"
"Announcers: we want to see racing 

Everyone else: SO DO WE"
THIS IS TOTO BOTH CARS USE THE KERBS
"Double James... Oh boy, even Mercedes isn't totally safe in 2020"
"Honestly, this race would become 10x better with a double Merc retirement"
Can we please see anything but the Mercs...
"No kerbs

Bottas' car in worse shape

Everything to play for

It's fucking Lewis Hamilton

This could get spicy"
Rip Williams Point Party :(
"We back in the 80s now bois, 1/4 of the field has retired so far with 2 more that could imminently blow up"
This restart is going to be 🌶️
"ALBON DO WHAT MUST BE DONE, DO NOT HESITATE, SHOW NO MERCY"
This isn't a proper race; it's an eliminator!
Even in a race with no audience we get audience shots
Probably shouldnt be advertising that vantage point on TV lol. There will be a lot more people there next week.
All eyes on Perez and Alex now
Albon was looking good on that first half lap. This new SC was a terrible break for him.
"His fucking tyre fell off, what the heck"
DAS- Alfa Edition
"This is the most hectic race I can remember in quite some time. Lot of craziness going on, I love it."
the front fell off!
Latifi to get points before Rusell if this keeps going haha
"Kimi practicing how to fire his wheel at an opponent to make the pass

Needs work tbh"
Lol imagine if both Kubica and Latifi got a point for Williams before Russell.
"Kimi, you will not have-a the wheel."
haha tyre go brr
Alfa is going to get a big scolding by the FIA following that
If Latifi gets a point I will die laughing. Poor George
F1 jumping in on the battle royale hype
how is Perez not required to give P3 back...?
"“The Kimster”

Did Ted really just say that?"
SAFETY CAR BOOGALOO
This is the M. Night Shyamalan movie of F1 races.
This is gonna be the spiciest DTS3 episode holy shit
Alfa Romeo has to get penalised for that. Flying tyres are no joke.
ALBON WAS AHEAD
Embarrassing for the constructors
"Well, looks like the reliability level is back to the 90s and early 2000s. Mighty interesting season looks like"
you know its fucking bad when Max tells that they cant win lol
Hopefully Albon can spice things up on his softs
YOU COULDVE JUST TAKEN YOUR TIME TOO ALBONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
Fuck fuck fuck
Albon's gonna start hating Lewis
Honestly fuck this
How can Lewis not have dmg?!?!
Lewis is so fucking lucky he never gets damage in these situations
"Amongst all the chaos, Charles has been quietly having a great race"
"LMAO, if after all this, we get a Mercedes-Mercedes-Ferrari podium."
5 seconds is a joke
That move by Charles was even more kamikaze than Max last year but Perez took avoiding action and now it’s praised
What even is this race?!
What kind of bumper cars is going on out here??
WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON
I think norris fucking did it?!?!?! And gets the bonus point!
HOLY SHIT LANDOOOOOOOOOOOO
CMON LANDOOOOOOO
The constructors have a lot to work on this week.
Look at all these engineers who thought they could build a car that can drive for 2 hours
Twitch streamer P3
Oh shit Lando! On the last lap!
LETS FUCKING GO LANDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
FUCK YES LANDOOOO
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NORRIS
"GERMANY AND BRAZIL ARE NOTHING COMPARED TO THIS HOLY SHIT

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

I'M DYING"
JUSTICE!!!!!!!! LANDO
This is what the year 2020 looks like
LANDO <3 <3 <3 <3
"Wow, Bottas 1st, Leclerc 2nd, Norris 3rd

F1 is back!"
Driver of the day? Leclerc? maybe Norris?
YEET WE MAY BE ONTO SOMETHING YALL
"YES!!!  GET IN LAD!!!   

Fastest lap and on the podium!!"
HOLY FUCKING SHIT 9 CARS OUT
That cgi billboard was awful
"What a finish I loved it.    
Bottas definitely had the porridge again.   
McLaren too wow"
Zak Brown looks like he’s gonna beat Norris to death in celebration with that determined walk lol
This totally made up for the mess that was Albon’s race
Mclaren second in the constructors
OUR BOY LANDO DID IT!
"YYYYYYYEEEEEEESSSSSSS

LANDO IS A MEME LORD"
LANDO ON THE PODIUM!! WHAT A RACE!!!
Max and Albox died for their friend Lando. Worth :'(
Latifi's debut and also best position of the entire 2020 season I'm sure.
"Lando absolutely bashing into the P3 pylon....I’ll let it slide, it’s his first time"
"After Qualifying I was kind of worried the second race here would be boring, but with so many retirements we could get a very different race next time"
"Toto: Ferrari is quick, they are p2 today."
WHAT A BANGER
Lmao 2 twitch streamers on the podium
"Albon died for this. Love the podium though, just wish he could be on it too. Nice to see he got DotD."
I'M SO PROUD OF LANDO
Wtf ferrari
Poor albon
Impressive from Leclerc hauling the Red Shed to the podium too
Albon has balls
Am I just drunk or did that race just happen ?
"So happy for McLaren and Lando right now. P3, 5 and fastest lap."
Easily the best sport in the world
If Ferrari can pull of another good demage controll race next week and the Hungary upgrades do their work then i could see them being back to a top 3 team. They obv have an amazing driver in Leclerc. The car atleast seems reliable more then the others and looks to be great in corners. So fixing that drag and engine could do wonders for them.
Today was Albon's joker moment
IMPRESSIVE HOW FERRARI GOT A PODIUM THIS WEEKEND
Proper Austrian welcome to F1 by greeting half the racers with a retirement. The curbs deserve a podium.
What a race. So happy for Lando.
Has the constructor rep ever had champagne in the past? I seem to recall them just getting sprayed by the drivers.
"Lewis: ""racing incident""
Seb: "" I'm glad in spun only once""

Taking responsibility not a strong suit for these two."
Have you ever been so excited for a Mercedes to walk away and win by 47 seconds!?!
Max's engine stalling out sounds like my ass after Taco Bell
The 5 second penalty is a joke. Twice now Hamilton has denied Albon his maiden podium and he just gets a small penalty whereas the whole race is ruined for Albon
Vettel really can’t get past Stroll... Ferrari truly built the shitbox of shitboxes
Was that Mercs version of Multi 21?
Surely Albon got that move completed
"Car without wheel parked on track

Crofty: “Kimi had a MASSIVE crash!”"
Anyone got the uncensored lando radio ?
10/10 for the Halo graphics this year. Rear view is awesome.
Give all your energy for a ALB-PER-NOR podium!
I cAn’T KeEP oFf ThIs KeRbs bONo!
Please stay on those kerbs. Please both mercs out. That podium would be a dream
RedBull complaint against Sergio Perez incoming.
Hamilton caused the accident. Albon already had him on the outside. That’s twice now. I would be super pissed as Albon right now
did RB just fucking loop a chopper?!?
"How the fuck is their official streaming service down 5 min before the race, what the fuck f1tv"
F1TV better partially refund this shit
You'd think FOM could buy a couple more servers to prevent F1TV from crashing before race start considering they're sponsored by AWS. Nope.
"fuck F1TV, seriously, not another year of this bullshit, that's not what I pay for"
Robottas is hauling ass.
Hamilton 35kph faster than Max on straights.. wow
Bottas misunderstood social distancing and thinks 2m means 2 minutes.
What's up with the Ferrari engine? Sounds so odd
Alonso is laughing somewhere rn.
Albon podium lets fucking goo
Well albons gonna get his podium I guess?
"Sucks, wait how long and get 12 laps :(  

Also think Max/Ham would be a good fight throughout the race."
Un-fucking-believable. Mercedes WDC confirmed.
"Verstappen fell for the old ""Hit Alt-F4"" trick."
For people saying it double sucks - it triple sucks because retirements are way more painful in a short season.
"I don't like Verstappen, maybe because of the hype but I would never wish that kind of ending for him. He is one of the exciting parts of F1 and he improved so much over the last 2 years. I feel very sorry for him, almost heartbroken."
Horner and Helmut trying to nickel and dime for every penalty possible just to DNF on home soil >>>>>
Racing point no power >>>>>> Ferrari power
"bruh ferrari pace is so slow, a slowed Racing point is still faster"
"r/f1: I like this driver

Gods of F1: no"
"Reliability issues everywhere, wow."
we all shit on the ferrari engine but every other engine already has a problem in 20 laps
"Formula 1 trying to appeal to the youth by changing to a battle royale format

Formula 1: Only one can finish the race"
"Mercedes, Honda and Renault. All gave up. Ferrari best engine confirmed."
Lance's retirement rips my heart.
"Williams never seem to have these issues, just saying."
"Looool, Ferrari with the fake pit stop, fighting for the 5th place, 2020 full of surprises"
"At least with all these retirements the odds of seeing a McLaren on the screen increases.

Oh, who am I kidding. It will be just Mercedes cruising around at that point."
Ferrari doing dummy for who lmao
Renault engine sounds like a plane taking off
"There are 5 teams in the top 6, so that's nice I guess"
Renault on board sound is bizarre.
Flawless double stack from Mercedes...
Bottas' worst nightmare has just came true
"Same shit different season

congrats lewis"
Gap destroyed. Sucks for Bottas. He’ll have to have the defensive drive of his life to fend off Hamilton.
"Brundle showing some strange pit lane thinking there

If there'd been another team (williams I guess) making a stop in the final bay, Perez would've had to either hit them or hit the Mclaren, it's was the definition of an unsafe release...."
"Oh. The pain....

Seb taken out by the guy replacing him..."
SBINAALLA!!!!
Well done Seb. Made it a whole 31 laps before binning it.
Oh Vettel. Oh Ferrari.
he sbinared again lmaooooo
"Vettel, 3 steps forwards and 7 steps back...

Poor bastard."
All Vettels fault there!   Locked it up!  Ridiculous move.
Russel is now only 2 places away from matching Williams' score for the entire 2019 season.
Dread it. Run from it. Lewis Hamilton still arrives
I'm straight up not having a good time lmao
Vettel has been in F1 since 2006 why on earth is he doing a move even the most psychotic racer in an online racing game would know will never come off?
Lewis hasn’t waited this long to race to sit behind Bottas for 35 laps
"How is a Ferrari having a hard time to pass a Mclaren and chased by a Mclaren is BEYOND me

Imagine saying that in 2018

This is like 2007 again"
"Mercedes want to tell their main, 6-time world champion, to back off and let Bottas win

Pahaha, fat chance"
Rear view mirror..cool!
That rear view mirror graphic is SICK
The Ferrari onboard sounds so weird somehow
Russell ahead of Kimi and Vettel. That's a brave new world I wasn't expecting to see...
The Renault sounds like my mum's vacuum cleaner from the 90's.
Charles is the cream in a McLaren Eclair
"Sensor issue on both Mercedes, albon wins"
Bottas needs our energy hummmmmmmm
"If both Mercs wreck, Williams will be in the points!"
"""Urgent Chassis Default 2-1""  Codewords"
> Guys pls seriously stay on the track ;-;
Cars are literally falling apart lol
Hamilton telling on Bottas to the teacher
Even the team radios are boring with Mercedes.
Member when more than one team had a shot at winning? I member
Bottas had a heartattack lol
This is essentially a broadcast of two cars going in circles.
Critical gearbox issue!
Oh shit mah boi James had to reel these guys back. Its serious.
VALTTERI ITS JAMES. LEWIS ITS JAMES.
"Guys dad here, enough with that shit."
I love the cheeky replies by Ham
Lewis it’s james
I would so love to see the Mercs suspension implode hahaha
"""Even badder Ted, that's the right word isn't it?""

""No it's worse""

LMAO"
Ferrari is actually slower than McLaren and force India
Grosjean's taking the scenic route. Might as well enjoy the drive if you're not in the points.
I'm cackling like a witch every time Merc drive over a curb
No brakes on two F1 cars is fucking terrifying.
"Bruh why Russell, I had high hopes for him..."
Austria is straight up murdering these cars
The mountain crew.
They found some spectators to film! Don't think I could have lived without at least one crowd shot..
Alex take our energy! Go for the win
Oh what a fucking cocktease
Goddamn these safety cars are like a breath of fresh air.
"God that must have been fucking terrifying for Vettel, even with the halo."
Hahaha the wheel just fell off
"UH, THE wheels are normally attached right??????"
Bwoah. Tire not on car.
"""Dude, where's my tire?"" -Kimi"
Wheel: Understandable have a nice day.
"> Fuck it I'm done.

The wheel probably."
That wheel reafirms the need of the halo
"Perez getting overtaken, then pushes to get it back under flags... tf is that"
Alex should be able to keep that position
That was wheely unfortunate for Kimi
Double Merc Dnf and we have a beautiful podium and a Williams point finish.
"6 teams in the Top 7, that's a plus"
shouldn't perez give back that spot to albon?
"7 retirements, all through technical issues. That has got to be some kind of record."
"I didn't expect the drivers to be rusty, but I certainly didn't expect the constructors to be rusty either."
Come on Alex get revenge for Brazil
Albon divebomb pls
Albon podium please
Oh poor Albon...
Lando podium dream
Hamilton penalty for Norris podium? That would be lit
My only prayer is that that knocked something loose on Hamilton’s car so we can get a not 1-2
AGAIN ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME
"Commentators twisting themselves into knots trying to not blame Lewis for that.

Had that been Vettel..."
Albon was ahead..
Hope Hamilton gets penalty and lando gets a podium.
Dude honestly I don't know how I feel about Ham's defense. I'm gonna have to see a lot more replays but it *looked* like Ham gave Albon the squeeze
"Mercs, just go poof, please..."
Giovinazzi just overtook Vettel..
Ferrari with the fastest lap what the heck
"LEC P2, yes please"
Ferrari strategist: stonks
Is the penalty applied at the end of race ?
"Penalty, never thought FIA would have the balls to do it"
Perez penalty! F1 Stewarding is back baby
This race is on cocaine
WTF IS THIS RACE
"Expectation: Double Mercedes Retirement.

Reality: Double Red Bull Retirement."
NO IDEA WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON BUT KEEP GOING
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS LOL
LMAO I can't with this race
Well I joked about half the field dying....
Netflix is creaming hard
And fastest lap!
LANDO PODIUM YES! GET THE MILK OUT BOYS!
YES LANDOOOOOOOO
LAAAAAAANDOOOOOOOOOO
WHY DID THIS RACE HAVE TO END OMG
LANDOOOOOOOOOOOOO
How much fucking time did Lando make up on the last lap? I can't believe he did that
Jesus Christ Norris that was masterclass... Fastest lap right at the end. Fuck me.
The most surprising thing about this result is honestly a Ferrari finishing 2nd.
THE TWITCH BOY IN THE PODIUM
"Albon died for this, GG to lando"
"WHAT AN INSANE RACE

I LOVE YOU FORMULA 1"
Holy shit Lando on the podium
"Wait what, did that really happen ? Podium and fastest lap ? Insane !!!!!!!"
Albon died for this
LAAAAANNNNNDDDDDOOOOOO
"Lando, you celebrate as much as you want"
LANDO DID ITTTTTTTT. FASTEST LAP AND 3RD PLACE??
Holy shit what a fucking last lap
"WHAT A FUCKIING RACE MANN
LANDOO HOLY SHIT"
LANDO POG
"Go Lando, go!"
What the fuck was that CGI billboard
LANDO HIT THE SIGN LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Lando Norris my goodness you beautiful little beast 💪😍
AMAZING RACE
LANDOOOOOOO
Great drive from Lando and Leclerc. F1s future is in good hands.
Lol this is crazy. Is there a season 3 netflix docs? This is gonna be interesting
THE MEME DREAM
"Yeah! GO Valtteri, for the championship"
Lando hitting the 3rd place marker at the end. What a race!
#what a race
I LOVE THIS GAME!!!
Ferrari on the podium is... what?
Someone needs to get the onboard of Norris' last lap
Albin would have won had he waited just one lap for drs.
Alonso seething rn
Mega drive by Bottas holy shit. Cheering hard for him
That was a wild ride. I hate seeing red bull retire but holy shit I'm happy for lando. Also big props for Charles!!
Well damnit Williams. So close. Yet so far.
"Great job Charles, surviving the carnage that was this GP and keeping a good pace to get that P2."
LANDO DRINKING THAT CHAMPAGNE LIKE MILK
Is lando old enough to drink?? Jk
That was an awkward cut out by ESPN
Can’t wait to see the Lando debrief interviews!
"The kneeling demonstration was a lovely, touching thing for them to do, but I couldn't help but crack up at a Renault driver (Didn't catch if it was Ocon or Danny Ric) doing the ""oh shit oh fuck I'm late"" hustle walk onto the drivers' area at the last second."
That’s Vettels fault
"some things never change. Death, taxes, my favorite driver spinning"
"THIS RACE IS SO BORING. AWFUL.


THIS RACE IS INSANE!!

Reddit, you are a strange beast"
albon has got to be 3rd wtf..
Another Albon sacrifice for a McLaren podium.
But mooooom! He's using the curb more than me.
5 seconds for destroying someone's race?
Anyone else got F1TV issues?
"Can the Mercedeses please run into each other, I want a chaos podium of Albon, Perez and Norris"
Latifi forgot to switch his car from formula 2 mode to formula 1 mode
Perez did Albon dirty wtf
Name something more iconic than Hamilton spinning out Albon
Hamilton needs a penalty for that
"This was the most unexpected 2nd place ever !!!

Cheers Norris, he got Hamilton and the bonus point in the end !!!

Hats off to McLaren.

Awful strategy from Racing Point.

Vettel, really, that is how you show you were treated unfairly? By finishing 10th in a...10-car race (Latifi is miles behind everyone) ?"
Hamilton just gave another podium to McLaren by taking Albon off
F for ALBONO 😔
F1TV is fucking shit.
Come on F1TV!! GET YOUR STUFF TOGETHER!!!
F1 TV is down here in Germany! Great technology for such a high-tech sports 💪🏼
The furthest I got with F1 tv is endless loading in the web player. Why do I keep paying for this shit...
What a fucking disappointment - been waiting so many months and then F1 TV is not working.
Its not looking good for F1 TV allowing to watch the race... tho whole apidboafdpvb reason I paid for it... any suggestions on where to stream it...
F1TV shitshow continues. Ahh nice to see that one thing didn't change. :)
Is anyone able to watch with F1TV? This is fucking ridiculous for how much it costs...
" Error code:**4.7.30** 

FUUUUUUUUUCK F1.tv!¡¡¡¡¡!!¡¡"
F1 TV not working. What a band of baboons
Jesus Christ Bottas is already gone
What's Brundle on about. Only top 2 teams have overtaken Norris. It's not like he's getting mugged left and right by midfield teams.
ARE YOU KIDDING RED BULL
Safety car pls let them bunch up
Verstappen just hearing the windows XP shutdown noise right now.
Please reconnect contoller 1
Albon seems pretty secure for a podium now
Merc 1-2. See you all in two years
"Ok tv director no need to see the front 2 for the rest of the race, concentrate on the midfield"
LATIFI WITH THE OVERTAKE /s
"This is what we get for not having a merc 1-2 start, disappointment to the highest degree"
Drive to Survive is with Red Bull too 😬😬😬
Software boys are getting a new hole
Setting the tone for the season then
rip max
"So, the question now is, can Norris get his first podium?"
There goes the race. The only team that could challenge merc drops out lap 12.
Netflix I don’t like the writing in this third series so far
"On the bright side, Albon v Norris for a podium!"
F1TV finally back after Verstappen retires. Coincidence?
Red Bull with the monkey paw appeal
"Help me Lando Norris, you are my only hope."
"ZZZZ, Mercedes ez WDC and WCC again. Here's to me hoping for a change and Bottas takes it."
Both Williams finishing above the top RedBull driver. Huge improvements.
"Ricciardo is battling ferrari again, not for a podium but at least battling ferrari"
F in the chat boys
Killed the race. Albon isn’t going to challenge the Mercs and the red cars are shit.
Waited 7 months for F1. Woke up early and cooked breakfast. And got to watch Verstappen race for 13 laps. At least there's only 1 week until the next race
"Ferrari and Renault fighting again... Is this 2006?

*\*sees positions\**"
"""two pedals in his car the right makes it go and the left makes it stop""

Martin sounding a bit like John Madden"
"Stroll with ""No power"" is still faster than a Ferrari. RIP"
Must be an on-board computer virus going around...
You know you are in a pit of shit when A broken Racing Point is faster than a ##fucking Ferrari
This is the first stage of the Ferrari Master Plan™
"Every engine but the Ferrari blows up, Ferrari 1-2"
Stroll directly into the garage...
"Reliability issues for Mercedes, Renault, and Honda cars, with none (so far) for Ferrari. Slow and steady wins the race?"
"3 in the top 10.  
  
And engines go poof"
"At this point it’s not even Merc dominance, it’s just Merc competence"
Starting to look like Le Mans lol
The safety car will probably have to retire
"It's a pit stop party, lmao."
Oh no! Magnussens controller disconnected
Thank fuck Perez saw Lando
Jesus fuck RP that was CLOSE
I am literally not understanding how this race is so batshit.
"Look at that Alfa tyre man shaking his hand, that was probably everyone's reaction."
The double stack was beautiful
lewis' career is the perfect combination of insane skill and unbelievable luck
THEY ALMOST FUCKED LANDO OVER WTF MCLAREN
Surprised by the mediums on Perez
"In what universe is Lewis Hamilton less than 1 second behind you ""playing into your hands""

Come on Martin"
Why does bottas tire already look dead?
Russell on P13! Hope he gets into the top 10
HES SPUN AGAIN
say the thing reddit
WHY VETTEL
VETTEL SPIN
P R O N T O
The memes truly write themselves
"Mercedes 1-2? Check

Williams last? Check

Grosjean bottling It? Check

Vettel spinning? Check

F1 is definitely back"
Vettel still ahead of Latifi lmao
damn vettel. overly optimistic there
That was a proper playstation overtake attempt from Vettel.
my only hope for this season now is for bottas to win the WDC
"dear mr george russell

pls hold on to 12th"
The on board engine audio is just comical
[deleted]
I haven't heard a Ferrari this high pitched in years
Is Latifi driving last years Williams?
Rearview cam is an interesting use of that graphic
Mercedes should turn their engines all the way off and then we can have a fun race
Inb4 Double DNF and we get an Albon win
yo that rear-view on the halo graphic is tight
rear view is legit
Can I get a uhhh McLaren sandwich
Stop showing Renault on boards pls. Fucking ear rape
"The Ferrari upshifts are very stuttery, sounds weird."
The one time they don't just follow the leaders we watch a full lap in clean air whilst Hamilton is looking to race his teammate for the lead.
The Renault sounds like a bag of rocks in a blender
Jesus that Renault sound
LET'S GO LANDO! MAXIMUM PACE!
MULTI 21
Mercedes need to be called Formula 0
Stay on the curbs Mercs
"Merc drivers be like: Instructions unclear, gonna hit the kerbs as hard as I can."
Toto's table bracing with fright/excitement as the track action continues....
Kerbs go brrrrrr
Seems as if everyone else is a midfield team today.
Imagine both mercs fail and Albon wins
"The whole ""2 seconds Ted"" has gotta be a running joke now, every time man"
"the merc race each other resulting in double engine failure. albon, norris, perez podium"
Finally Mercedes have some competition - the curbs
"Did Brundle just read out a dictionary definition of a kerb?

FFS"
"""Sensor issue"""
You know it's serious when James gets on radio.
They're still on the curbs lmfao
"Come on Merc sensors, do some good today and break down"
Perez is two seconds of the lead if the Mercedes DNF...
ALEX THIS IS YOUR FUCKING MOMENT
I don't believe in this sensor bs
"Ferrari literally have built a midfield car, this Hungary upgrade better be a miracle worker but I somehow doubt it"
alright who cursed the entire grid
"Haas is a comedy of errors. At this point, they exist purely for Drive to Survive entertainment value."
Albon on the tail of 2 wounded Mercs. Praying to F1 Jesus for some RBR magic.
Suddenly when everybody is on fresh tyres the sensor issue will be gone...
"""Conky""-the sound of an F1 car retiring

Martin Brundle, 2020."
"ALBON DON'T YOU BREAK MY HEART TOO!

FIGHT MY BOY"
"""Oh shit! My car has issues"" \**sets fastest lap\**"
ALBONO PLS
ALEX ALBON TAKE MY ENERGY
Imagine if Latifi gets points before Russel
"Wow, that brings some scary memory. Kimi's tyre coming off!"
His tire just fell off WTF
Everybody left in is going to score points by the end of this race
The front fell off
what on earth is this race
This race is bananas
I'm pretty new to F1 but I don't think that's supposed to happen
Lol Kimi's tyre was like I dont wanna be a part of this anymore.
Looks Like Albon Was Ahead There
Is Alex about to get screwed out of a podium
"Well, at least this race isn't too boring!"
well the front ^^^right fell off
"Right front tire inner monologue: ""FREEEEDDDOOOMMMM"""
"The entire paddock is rusty, retirements left and right, and now a loose wheel"
Surely Alfa is going to get penalties for that. That could've taken out anyone ahead or behind.
Perez should give that place back
How was Albon not considered 3rd place?
"Barring another retirement, there are only three finishers that will not get points"
35% of the field is out
"I don't now if I like this race or hate this race so far  
  
I'm laughing though"
"Well done, ~~Baku~~ Spielberg!"
That's a great race! Definitely worth waiting for 7 months
"Sweet Jesus, the first race of 2020 is *not* disappointing thus far. If only there were rain..."
Every car is going to be in the points at this rate
Too much masala (spices) in this race
[deleted]
COME ON ALBON
"Come the hell on, how long do they need to keep the SC out?"
It's happened again
AGAIN!? SERIOUSLY?
C'MON ALBON
FUUUUUUUUUCKKK AGAINNNN NOOOOOO
"""gReAt DeFeNsE bY lEwIs"""
My hope is now all on a norris podium
"Yeah, fuck right off Hamilton, holy shit."
Fucking lol the red bull crew reaction
FUCK SAKES MAN
"sky biased again, blaming albon for being impatient"
Haha Lewis broke the car *and* he's gonna get a time penalty
Alex deserved that podium mann :(
This race is 2020 on brand.
Albon robbed. Hamilton must be penalised.
"Come on Charles, get the Pink Copycat !"
"This is so wrong, this Ferrari shitbox in the podium."
"Fair penalty there they had to give it, prob lucky it wasn't more but yea"
LEC/PER podium??
Man that 5 seconds will certainly make up for the fact Albon got knocked all the way out of the points.
What a drive Charles
"Stewards: “5 sec penalty for HAM, that’ll do it.”

Lewis: “activate fastest lap.”"
Push Landoooo!
The race has turned into a math problem.
Figuring out the finishing order is some slide rule shit at this point
This race is 1 giant shit show
ONE MORE DEATH AND WILLIAMS POINTS
LATIFI GETS A POINT???? LMAO
What in the everliving fuck is happening
"*Breaking News*

No cars for next week"
Lando P3 lets goooo

LANDO BOT
"Fuck yeah lando!!!!,"
"9 retirements, podium decided by penalties, same track next week. What a start to the season."
GOD TIER LANDO!!!! Saved the race for me!
They decided to pack anything that would have happened in the cancelled races into  this one. Holy shit.
"BOTTAS, LECLERC AND LANDO OHMYGOD IM I DREAMING IS THIS FOR REAL"
FERRARRIIIII PULL A PODIUM OUT OF THEIR ASSES
L3NDO
Lando! Holy shit.
"Such a shame we lost Max and Alex, but so happy for Lando."
Second time in a row a Mclaren gets a podium because Albon and Hamilton collide.
"LANDO P3!!

YES LAD!"
Albon DOTD? huh?
2 POINTS FOR GIO can't fucking believe it
ALEX DIED SO LANDO COULD LIVE
Inject this into my veins
I love that kid Lando. :D
I'm so happy for McLaren and Lando. So proud!!
Holy flying fucking fuck what a race. Didn't expect that ending.
“ Ferrari suck” - P2
2 mid field teams on the podium pog
What a race! My poor dogs had no idea why I’ve been screaming at the tv for two hours. What. A. Race.
And Carlos's great last lap overtake got overshadowed by his own teammate. Classic Sainz
I'm scared of lewis now
STREAMER GANG RISE UP
No internet issues for Lando this time
"For all the shit they took, Ferrari 2nd."
Is this a f1 gameplay?
"WHAT A RACE! It should have been Mercedes 1-2 and Ferrari nowhere, but what a turn of events that was!"
MCLAREN IS BACK BABY
Binotto is like “I told you everything is alright”
I am so so happy for Lando! What a final lap from him!
Nothing like ditching the ol' ball and chain to cheer up Bottas
This is your year Valtteri!
Vettel deliberately staying in 10th so he has the full set of grid finishing positions
"Sad for Albon, he could've won this race"
Podium for Lando!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bottas for World Champion!
Frekin sad for albon..
I love this simplistic podium
Lando looks so small on the podium ahahahahaah
"Who would've thought Red Bull would come out with 0 points today, mental"
"Ah yes, the german national anthem oh how i've missed it  😂"
I'm so fucking happy for Norris
"Expectation: The drivers will be so rusty, we'll see so many mistakes

Reality: The cars/engineers are so rusty, they're are all breaking down"
S🅱️innella bby
You saw that SPIN COMING FROM A MILE AWAY
Seb is back
Who’s got the coffin dance meme queued up? Lol vettel.
Latifi still racing like he's in F2.
Show 👏🏻 Albon 👏🏻 and 👏🏻 Pérez 👏🏻 positioning  👏🏻
Hamilton left no room albon was ahead
Lewis getting out of the car in the pits has me satisfied
"Bottas is really likeable, I hope he wins it all this year."
Good job Leclerc too. Ferrari is still in deep shit this season but how you bring it home on the bad days really count.
"I swear Mercedes do this every single time they are flying in first. 

""LOOIS WE AVE ISSUE PLEASE MONITOR IT""

'BONO TYRES GONE NEED MORE POWER'


""LOOIS IS EXPLODE IF WE DONT GO SLOWER""

'BONO TYRES ARE GONE HAVE TO PUSH'

""OK LOOIS KEEP PUSHING WE WILL TELL YOU MORE SOON""

Then nothing happens. I swear they manufacture bullshit to keep the audience interested and watch the two Mercedes prance around for another 40 minutes."
"7 dnfs

Vettel still not in the points."
"As a Black American watching formula one, I love this, regardless of kneeling or standing, this coming together brings tears to my eyes. It's not about forcing a quota, it's not about the black live matter org ( they are useless), and it's not about ""white people bad"" talking points. It's about police reformation, end racism, and the ability to give chances to minorities who may or may not know about formula one. I want diversity based on merit, but if the school programs, teaching, materials are gate kept to only the affluent areas( not saying that only white ppl got money, because there are rich blacks and poor whites) then something radical has to be done."
Ferrari 2020: commentators celebrating VET passing Racing point to become 8th
"[x] Mercedes dominating

[x] Vettel spinning

[x] Renault and Red Bull crapping out



...nothings changed."
"""Battle for the constructors' championship""

Nice joke, Crofty."
[removed]
MULTI 21 CONVINCE ME OTHERWISE
Ride those curbs boys. Give us a good race
GET IN THERE SENSORS
Kimi looking for his yacht
"""Now we look back with sadness to those we have lost in the 2020 Austrian Grand Prix...""

\*sad music intensifies\*"
Laps 1-60 meh. Laps 61-71 HOLY SHITTTTT
LOL that cringe fake billboard
Red bull double DNF ahahaha who could've predicted this
"Feel terrible for George this week, he would've been in the points."
Demolition and then a boy who drinks milk finishes on podium
"Im like a kid on christmas morning, absolutely buzzing to see f1 back"
Lmao Toto did not seemed phased by the penalty at all. That man knows the Merc is gonna fly past the cars in front.
"Meanwhile, f1tv is looking like a bunch of vankers, again."
Stroll will get a podium before a ferrari this year. Calling it now. Actually he will get more than vettel
"Toto does not seem to be too phased about HAM penalty.

Inb4 Merc P1-P2 at the end of lap 2."
Is f1tv working for you guys?
"For those who sort by new, try F1TV on mobile! Working for me"
"Setting up a VPN and watching an ""alternative"" F1 stream was quicker than waiting F1TV to load. 8€/month btw."
Is F1TV working for anyone?
Anyone else in the US still not getting access to their F1 TV Pro? This is bullshit at this point
Bottas already in the next postcode but dear god it's so nice having more than three teams fighting for those top spots.
"Fuck F1 TV, spent money doing it legally and I miss the first two laps."
Black Merc is like a SR-71 man
This looks like a really good scenario for Verstappen
Can't believe im paying for this horrendous service that is F1 TV
Bottas social distancing very nicely
Red Bull are going to be absolutely happy with this pace. Verstappen looking dangerous
Ferrari is a really strong midfield team!
"5 to 10 are orange - pink - red - orange - pink - red.

That's not a pattern we've seen often before."
Ferrari not even going to win formula 1.5
"Laps Williams was 17th on pace in 2019: 0

Laps Williams was 17th on pace in 2020: 1.


By the year 3000 they might win something."
Ferrari looking solid.. in the midfield
Sad williams hours :(
"Who else got f'ed by f1 tv?? I now it says to not post threads about streams but the linked subreddit is not surfacing F1 links - anyone?? Can't believe I'm on my 2nd year of paying for f1 tv and it still doesn't work, what a bunch of amateurs."
"Pink car and Orange car have more showtime than Red car, who would’ve thought."
Mercedes with DRS is just an unfair advantage.
God I hate DRS
Kvyats passed two cars in 2 laps and we haven't seen them
Are Mercedes cars back to burning oil? Tracing point and Mercedes consistently smoking
I like Martin's idea of changing the DRS zones between weekends.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
"Oh well, the 2020 season was fun while it lasted."
Max will deinstall this game probably
ctrl alt del or something xD
RIP RBR
Welp that’s the race!!!
F for Red Bull and Verstappen
He’s got to be furious.
Gotta feel for Max. Thats a huge dent in the championship.
holy shit that went from bad to shit in seconds
At this point they should just move Mercedes into their own classification. At least races will be interesting.
ZZZzzzZZZzzzZZZzzzZZZzzz
"Me, a fan of Albon: please don't suffer the same fate

Also me, a fan of McLaren: .... Suffer the same fate 😈"
There are only two car that's capable of fighting Mercedes and one of them is already gone. What a way to start a season.
Mercedes is cool and all. But damn these races would be so much more interesting without them lol
Seb literally can’t overtake because of this god awful engine
"Well you asked for the midfield, be careful what you wish for"
[deleted]
Jesus that Ferrari can't even pass Stroll with his engine problem. What a fucking shit box
And the hype of a new season lasted 12 laps *sigh*
What is this race?
NOOOO DANNY WHAT THE FUCK
French reliability
dannyyy noooooooooooooooooo....fuck renault man
Well if half the cars end up having a mechanical meltdown I won’t feel quite so bad about Max...
The Bash Brothers both out. Brutal
Austria. Return of the Renault Engine
Ah the dark magic from toto
Bad day to have a 3 in your number.
Oh hey look a haas....forgot they were here
Only engine manufacturer without any technical issues so far is ferrari =)
"If Lewis can take two tents out of valtteri each lap, it will take Lewis about 30 laps to catch VB"
"So only Ferrari engine has not given up!!! Oh, the irony..."
Maybe Williams can get a point if these engines keep blowing up.
I don’t hate Mercedes but I have so much hate for the 1-2. It’s so boring
Vettel 8 seconds behind Sainz. Jeez
"Engines getting Covid-19. Next up, engines getting tested for the Coronavirus."
kimi really wringing that shitbox
Who would have thought Ferrari would be the most reliable power unit today? lol
"Already 3 retirement? Bruh, it's only the first race of the season."
Hamilton has gained 2.5 seconds on BOT since Max retired.
Ferrari engines yet to have a problem...maybe they shifted the tab from power to full reliability
Bottas hype dying quicker than expected
Sounds like Ocons Renault engine runs on gravel from the onboard.
Lol can barely hear Crofty over the Renault
Has Haas ever considered entering a drift racing competition? Might be worth looking into.
Racing Point unsafe for sure
"Mercedes are just another top tier team

They perfect the double stacks

They're like Formula 0 now"
I love double stacks. I am going to be watching that pit break for a while.
"Formula 1:


The game where Mercedes shows up and holds a finger on all the other teams forehead as they desperately swing, but their arms are too short to land a punch."
Grosser Preis von Retirereich
"I’ve been watching this sport since before I can even remember. I was wearing a Ferrari onesie as a baby.

This is just hard to watch. :("
Didn’t wanna hear Lewis’s radio then anyway...
It's honestly ridiculous how Mercedes are the only team capable of making a working car
Can the mediums Perez is on make it to the end from here?
Ohhh that AMG SLS sounds good as fuck
"That was a bit of an open goal, to be fair, I'm glad Crofty took his shot at a ""DAS is…"" joke."
MISSION SPINNOW
VETTEL SPUN OUT HOLY SHIT
Spin memes are back on the menu bois
Adding insult to injury a bit for Seb eh
This race has EVERYTHING.
He did it!
terrible decision by Seb
OH THE FUCKING MEMES
Oh seb mate
S🅱️inalla
I've seen that before
Classic Vettel
Meh what else is he going to do? Hang out in 9th all race? Gotta spice things up
S🅱️INALLA
That was a stupid move by Vettel
Merc will have constructors in the pocket by race 8. Damn
All we need now is Hamilton complaining on the radio and we've completed F1 bingo
"I swear to God

You can't make this race up

Its like every meme of the past two years in a single race"
Damn was hoping Lando would run interference for Alex
Latifi still driving in F2
Engineer definitely turned off the mic so he could mutter “fuck your engine life”
Latiffi dude are you on a bike bro?
Team orders on the first race lmao
The rear view camera 🤯🤯
"Hamilton: need to watch the car
Also Hamilton : fastest lap 
:o"
"That is a very cool addition to the halo graphic, tbf."
Oh shit. That graphic looks insane.
The Ferrari sounds like a vacuum cleaner
I know we complained about not seeing midfield but I'd rather watch hamilton bottles then a Ferrari doing nothing
The scenes if we get a disqualification in this race
Ferrari engine sounds like it's hitting a wall at the end of the straights.
That that rearview mirror in the Halo shot is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yeah that new cam from the top of the car and all the necessary graphics is top notch. Great upgrade from last year’s car-cam.
"r/f1 last year: Wtf director show the midfield! 

r/f1 this year: Wtf director show the leaders!"
I'm still hurt about the Seb thing...
Why does Ocon's engine sound like it has evil demons inside it?
The Renault sounding like an exorcism there..
is it just me or does the renault sound really weird?
That Renault sounds horrible. It sounds like it's going to break itself.
"Plan A?

Ferrari: what is that?"
I hate Red Bull and Ferrari for allowing Mercedes to win free championships these last 6 years.
Merc just teasing
Yes Maximum pace
ocon's engine sounds like a washing machine full of spanners when he's on the power
Chassis default 2-1 sounds a lot like multi 21. Is that Mercedes trying to call of the race?
toto is so fashionable with his clear mask and clear glasses
~~Multi~~ Chassis 21?
"Williams ahead of Ferrari, welcome back f1"
"Didn't Stroll's Merc engine have sensor issues? I know there are like a billion sensors and they might not be related, but still"
Merc bois not listening
2 seconds Ted
2 seconds Ted
"fucking hell, this is 2014 all over again, mercedes running away with it"
Can we see other cars please
"Where were u when car was kill? I was on kerb when James ring ""Car is kill"" ""no"""
Has anyone seen Sainz?
"Actual overtakes in the midfield 

But no let's watch more of Lewis and Valtteri keeping a gap"
CriTiCaL
ISSUE IS CRITICAL! SYNCHRONIZED BOOM FOR MERCEDESES
STAY OFF THE KERBS!
Damn the red and white ones too
They had to warn them a second time and more strongly 😂
Vettel can't pass Russell jfc.
"If by some miracle, both the Mercedes were taken out of the race, it would make it so much more interesting"
Toto's table must be getting very worried.
How is Vettel still 14th and behind a Williams?
STAY ON THE CURBS MATE PLEASE
"Love this commentary, they seem to be having a lot of fun"
"If the Mercedes gearbox issues actually come to fruition, we could be in for one hell of a podium."
How has Vettel not passed Russell yet?
"VET still not past RUS

Edit: Nevermind"
Is Liberty gonna show something else other than the Mercedes doing absolutely nothing?
Is Vettel having to race Russell?
"Merc’s have been detuned and cannot hit the corner exits, but are still faster than the field. 

#RIP2020"
We've seen 10 laps of nothing but mercedes cruising. Show some other cars ffs.
grosjean :(
Russell is gone
Russel nooooo :(((
NOOOOOOO GORGEOUS GEORGE
Oh no George!
"Jesus, every car is getting battered."
"SIX Retirements, SIX"
YAAAAS SAFETY CAR
"Brakes slow you down. Therefor just get rid of the brakes.

- Haas"
"Welcome to 2020, where ALL the cars break"
"""he has the slip road in his sat nav"""
at least we're getting a restart with the safety car
Warzone pro Norris will be loving that this race is basically being turned into a battle royale. Last man standing...
"Vettel might be back in the point, at the rate cars are dropping out..."
"I feel really bad for Russell, virtual champ in equal cars then has to sit in a Williams in real life"
Checco or Albon with a chance of a podium is cheering me up about Ricciardo being out.
6 cars out and 0 crashes
Those guys on a hill...hahaa!
Scenes if more cars DNF And lathifi gets a point before Russell
"People be like the drivers gonna be rusty as hell, when it's actually the cars."
"Man, this is going to be really interesting.

Will Albon finish 3rd *or 3rd*?"
"If there’s one crumb of goodness to come from this year, I’ll take a Albon or Perez win."
I don’t see Haas in F1 much longer.
"*yellow flags at a restart but no Haas cars are in the race*

*confusion ensues*"
Well theres your problem.... The wheel fell off
Latifi gonna luck into a point
Guys Latifi is 2 positions away from points. This race is insane
Bruh the Drive to survive episode of this race finna be lit.
"See Lewis, now *that's* a tyre that's actually gone"
Albon had Checo and was steaming for Lewis
"What a shitfest,I love it"
Epiccc Alphamaxnova1 video incoming
"I thought albon had passed already. Did Perez pass after he slowed down for the safety car?

Edit: Yep. Albon slowed for the safety car. Perez kept going for a split second longer. Perez should give that place back I reckon. Not saying it was intentional, but the move was complete."
Holy shit that wheel decided it didn't like going that way.
That is albons spot.
Imagine Vettel's luck if that tyre hit him
Can we add like 10 more laps please
Should Albon have the place?
7 mechanical-related DNFs so far ... INSANE.
Is anyone surprised that a grand prix held in 2020 is a shitshow?
[deleted]
Kimi driving that Alfa with three wheels faster around the corner than the Williams last year with four wheels 😂
Alvin should be p3
VET getting points because 10+ cars retired
Vettel will probably get points again lol
OK NOW WE JUST NEED BOTH MERCEDES TO DNF AND WE'LL BE GOOD
This race is bingo
Williams may get a point by default at this rate
" RIGHT FRONT WHEEL, GLOVES AND RIGHT FRONT WHEEL GIVE IT TO ME"
"Kimi, too much DAS!"
If 2020 was a race
"We officially have less finishers than last year's German GP, and all without rain..."
Why Kimi didn't stay on the left side of the track? It could be safer to remove the car or not?
FIND THE NUT TED!
"When was last race with this much attrition? 7 retirements, wow"
Russell would’ve been in the points
I see how Ferrari is willing by reliability this season
"Its gonna truly be ""Survive To Drive"""
Albon wasn’t in front of Perez?
Vettel was a lucky boy there with Kimi's wheel
Driver of the day: Bernd Mailänder
Absolute shithouse year this is going to be. There's only 13 drivers left and Vettel isn't even in the points.
At this rate Latifi will score his first points before Russel
Albono podium
Max didn’t even feel like he had a chance. This is bad news for all of us man.
"Williams’ new driver only one place behind Vettel, as we all expected at the beginning of the race"
WHAT THE FUCK NO
Hamilton spinning out Albon LMAOOOOOO
Brooooooooo
Is Brundle putting blame on Albon for that?!
"""albon might beat me ? Better smash him again lol""

- Hamilton"
Deja Vu for Albon
HES A AHEAD HAMILTON WTF
Of fucking course.
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooi
This race is like a highlight reel of last season.
Not again FUCKKKKK
You need patience?! How is that on Alex?
Hamilton got urgent problems now too? Juicy
GOD DAMMIT
Almost looked like Lewis understeered into him or something
F for Alex
"Come on Norris, you're my final hope. Podium pls."
Albon and Hamilton incident under investigation
LANDO TAKE MY ENERGY
"Was so hoping Albon's radio would be him saying ""LEEEWWWISSSS"""
Rip landos podium chances
"they're just gonna let hamilton get away with fucking over Albon AGAIN, fuck this stupid fucking sport lmao"
HAHAHHAHA
This is more of a meme than the virtual gps lol
"Leclerc, how in the fuck did he do that. Driver of the day by far"
Imagine Ferrari win this loool
McLaren podium pls
CLOSE THE GAP LANDO P3 IS YOURS SON
NORRIS PODIUM WIIIIII
What in the FUCK is happening?
THIS RACE IS SO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
9 retirements crazy
Guess they still think damage is set to off
"At this rate, the safety car is going to be in the points."
LANDO PODIUM
LANDOS DONE IT
FUCK YES NORRIS
Go Norris Go Norris
Norris sets a fastest lap! HOW CLUTCH IS THAT!
Holy shit Leclerc about to clutch up second place in that shitbox. Nuts.
Yay! Podium for Norris! Yay!
"NORRIS PODIUM

NORRIS PODIUM

HAMMY IN FOURTH"
Yes LANDO!
"Norris fucking did it the mad man, half a second in the last half of the lap"
LANDO P3 LANDO P3 LANDO P3
LANDOOOOOOOOO
YYYEEESSSSS
C'MON LANDO
YES LANDO!!!
LANDOooooOOoooO9o
WHO SAID THIS RACE WAS BORING
LANDO!!!!! WHAT A DRIVE!!!!!
Man Lando laid it down on the last lap!
LANDO YOU FUCKING LEGEND
GET THE FUCK IN THERE LANDO!!!!
LAndo DONE IT
WHAT A RACE WHAT A RACE INJECT IT INJECT IT
YES LANDO LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOO!
Not even mad happy for both Lando and Charles great race from both of them
Mclaren are the winners this race and they had the Netflix crew with them aswell!
FUCKING YES LANDOOOOOO !!!!!!
YES BOOOOOOOYSSSSS
What a wild last 10 laps
LANDOOOOO
Albon died for this!
McLaren are second in the Constructors. It's 2003 again.
"All hail the memelord, the savior, Lando Norris!"
Omg what a race. Landooooo!!!!!
losing my shit at lando hitting that sign
"Wow, that billboard graphic was bad."
How about all those predictions? Did not see any of this coming
sim racing experience translating well on track
Hahahah Lando hits the 3rd position sign
This race was the definition of the Vince McMahon meme
"Albon NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

GO NORRIS!"
Albon driver of the day? Is that fan vote throughout the race?
Norris go boop
"If someone told me it was going to be Bottas, Leclerc, and Norris on the podium at the beginning of the race, I would have laughed."
LANDO P3!!!!!!!!!!!
Landoooooooooooo
Lando needs a proper podium celebration.
Same time next week boys?
Wow what a race
"Just reminding everyone to take a few seconds to breathe, because I haven't done that for about five minutes."
My god what a finish! Great advert for the season to come.
I did not expect this outcome except for the Bottas P1
"I'm having a sudden urge to buy a Rolex now, not sure why"
My goodness im so happy for this team.
What a race! Brilliant drive from Leclerc and the mclarens. Vettel is past his prime. Hamilton has a pack after him this season. Congrats Bottas.
"Charles, my guy, a *little bit* of luck? :p"
That was insane
"Whoa despite trailing for most of the race, Leclerc managed to get a podium for Ferrari."
IMAGINE LANDO DID THAT AMAZING LAP ALL RACE!
"We may be in a weird world-changing period right now... but hell, it's good to have F1 back, and what a great final 10 laps.

Great stuff Norris, having a strong teammate in Sainz will help bring the best out of him."
Lmao this is so strange
Great job by Charles for getting that Ferrari to second place as well.
I'm sure everyone were expecting a Ferrari in the podium and 0 Red Bulls...
Are they going to get fined for spraying their fluids all over everyone now?
the champagne is back
This was super exciting! I want more.
"Wait a minute....is the next race also at the same track?

Will there be any modifications or as it is?"
"On the first turn Norris will take the lead while Ocon takes out everyone in the field except Russel.

On the final lap Norris's car will split in half while crossing the checkered flag.

Final Standings 1. NOR 2. NOR 3. RUS"
"Mercedes engines are smoking, hmmmm"
So the only spicy story here is if bottas plays no 2 or not
WHY does this have to happen to the ONLY ONE who can make this interesting now
Unsafe release 100%. Why are the commentators trying to justify it?
"Ah yes

Sbin"
[deleted]
"Hahahahaha. This season is over, merc talking about turning the motors down already"
"BOT and HAM crash, ALB PER NOR Podium

A man can dream."
"Stay off the curbs 

Try 2, stay of the curbs both cars

Try 3, this is a gearbox issue stay off the curbs


STAY OFF THE FUCKING CURBS OMG"
"Ferrari cheated with their PU to force everyone else to compromise on their reliability.

900D chess by Sbinotto."
Hamilton fucking up Albon's podium AGAIN
That's twice Albon got screwed now!
"LANDOOOOO! Real dumb by Mercedes though, should have had Bottas move over."
"I said it yesterday, and I’ll say it. Lando, WHAT A LEGEND. Under the pressure of the last lap, he PULLED IT OUT OF THE BAG!

I remember meeting him after his F2 race, with no crowd, in 2018. He was such a lovely guy! Weird to think that same kid has joined the ranks of F1 podium winners!

Well deserved 🧡"
Great race from LeClerc. I get the feeling he got everything out of the car that he could. And holy shit Lando with the incredible last lap so happy to see him on the podium.
"Podium: 1. Norris, 2. Sainz, 3. Ricciardo

Mercedes engines will explode, the red bulls will have an insane crash with both the Racing Points. That's my prediction"
"This is like F1 bingo at this point

* Honda engine failure
* Grosjean going off track
* Ricciardo technical retirement
* Vettel spin
* Haas looking like vankers
* Hamilton victory?"
"Hamilton fault, expect a penalty"
"Charles getting absolutely everything out of that car, what a drive"
Literal tractor in 2nd place. Gotta give it to Charles
"God I’m so happy F1 is back, this is the best 1st race ever"
It's gotta be lewis' fault..
Lol looks like Sainz could teach Hamilton how to avoid cunting someone off the track
"Charles is a fucking monster, so good"
"WE ARE BACK BOIS

ITS BEEN SO LONG"
Just give the Mercs the 2020 championship trophy already. This looks like an utter farce. Oh dear...
Excitement just went from 100 to 0
Formula 1.5 fans should be excited about the start of the season. Williams is slowly coming down to the rest of the field and series have  the new member: Ferrari...
"Hot damn, Haas manages to do the first pit stop of the year and gets ALL FOUR tires attached properly!"
"Where do we sit on F1 bingo so far?

* Vettel making a mistake and spinning

* Ricciardo's car breaking down

* Mercedes 1-2

* Williams being lapped within the first stint

* Grosjean taking a trip across the gravel

Edit: We're missing Hamilton's ""Tyres are dead"" message, followed by a fastest lap"
That mini rear view mirror is very cool
"Latifi is getting lapped in not to long, while Russell sits in 12th"
Hamilton’s taking a new approach this season. Instead of knocking each other off the track they’re going to blow up their engines
Boring. 1-2 procession. Show us the other drivers then.
VALTTERI ITS JAMES HOURS WHO UP
You can't be *too* patient in F1.  Passing opportunities are few and far between.
"In the grand scheme of things,it’s a win win for Mercedes because their only rivals redbull have 0 points."
Bottas WDC lets have it
All 3 of these guys on the podium were playing/taking part in off-season e-Sports. Glad to see it.
"Horner hoping Lewis will apologise.

Yeah, good luck with that mate."
Alex shouldnt pick his words today. He should let it all out on Lewis.
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
"Race day. Finally.

It does gives me chills to see the drivers and crew taking the knee on the grid."
"I have missed this thread with all you guys so much, I am so glad to be back!"
"With Ferrari's lack of pace, in order to get some points, they'll need to rely on a good strategy....

We're fucked"
"The Mercedes look amazing, by far the best livery on the grid."
"F1 Tv is only working on my phone and not on my browser, probably only because I logged in for Quali. Its such a joke.

We get only 2 months of free subscription due to Covid which is disrespectful as fuck towards customers and then the whole thing doesn't work for season start. What a joke."
"Can we get a new font for the sign on the side of the Pit Building by the time of the next race?

[I know its supposed to say 'End Racism', but I can't unsee it saying '2nd Racism'.](https://imgur.com/1sGEmVZ)"
"I paid $80.00 to watch Formula 1. 

Now I am forced to find a stream elsewhere. 

F1TV is a fucking failed service."
F1TV is completely down for me on the app and on the web page ...
"F1TV: 
""We are aware of some Fans experiencing intermittent issues with F1TV . Our engineers are working hard to resolve the issue and will have further updates shortly""

IN 5 minutes after the start and the first 5 laps all this will be useless."
"F1TV taking notes from Ferrari.
Amazing, much worse than before."
Bro wtf is F1TV not working well? Or is it just me?
First F1 race ever! Have spent the last few weeks watching Drive to Survive and YouTube videos learning about rules/history pretty obsessively. Super excited!
"2.5s difference already, Bottas has already won. Here's hoping for a WDC win à la Rosberg."
Bottas has called the front desk and is checking the fuck out.
"F1 tv not working, how are u guys watching?"
McLaren dropping back :( dammit
Happy to see Albon up front.
That Merc is menacing AF
Go on Albon show us what you’re worth mate!
It feels good that we have an RB driver next to Max that can actually hold up competing cars
Best part about no crowds is no annoying shots of them
"Albon is actually holding Lewis off, he's earning that seat."
I keep forgetting Kimi is still in F1 until one of the announcers mentions him.
"Mercedes is the new 2019 Ferrari, but it corners like a Mercedes."
"Ferrari's season is already over, isnt it?"
A Ferrari fighting to stay 10th..
The collective sound of so many F1 fans wanting to commit suicide right now...
Oh max...you were our only hope
Mercedes 1-2 ffs
Well that makes the race a whole lot less exciting... Here is hoping for Albon's first podium!
"Damn, you can see Max fighting against the HANS device trying to get the car to go, sucks for him."
HELLO DARKNESS MY OLD FRIEND
"Oh for god's sake, had really high hopes for Max. Said to my girlfriend at the start of the race that he either wins or the car breaks within 20 laps. So typical."
Well there goes our only hope of a non Merc 1-2. Gee I've missed this crushing disappointment for the past 200 days :)
Software boys are getting a new hole
Ctrl alt delete lol
God dammit all...
"McLaren could be 2nd on the team standings after this race, holy shit."
Just ignore Mercedes being in their own dimension and it's a really close field. That's what I'm gonna do.
What a disappointment
Red Bull about to file a protest because Max's car broke.
"If that’s an engine munched, any hope of a Max WDC is probably shot, too."
"Roses are red, violets are blue, max is stalling, Mercedes 1 - 2"
"It's the Ferrari v Mercedes battle we've been waiting for. Yeah, the Mercedes may be a bit pinkish for some reason but don't let it affect you."
Mercedes 1-2 and Albon 3rd great
If Hamilton somehow makes up a 7 second gap on Bottas we might as well cancel this season lmao
Don’t worry Stroll even with your engine dying it’s still better than Ferrari
"On the bright side, we're going to watch Hamilton hunt down Bottas in the rnd"
/r/Formula1Point5 Deciding whether any other team shouldn't be included other than Merc.
For Stroll to be holding off Vettel and my boy Daniel while having engine problems is impressive.
"NOT RIC TOO

FUCK THIS SEASON"
"Fuck, not Danny too"
Is everyone got engine problem these days
Renault. What a disaster.
NOT DANIEL TOO
Danny Ric's gearbox is gone I'd say.
"""The drivers are gonna be rusty with 200+ days without racing""

The engines: Hold my beer"
Renault gonna Renault
"Ah yes, RIC AND VER out just like in the good ol' days"
Riccardo is thirsty for that McLaren now I bet.
FORMULA ONE I WANTED YOU BACK BUT NOT LIKE THIS 😭
Did Latifi go around unscrewing things last night or something
"nice so max now danny ric is out.

thank you 2020"
At least Max and Danny have each other
Ferrari only engine thats gonna last the race
Aaand Grosjeans spun off
Whoever commented 'motorona' before seems to be onto something
[deleted]
Genuinely disappointed for Stroll
Grosjean’s entire life is driver error.
So what's everyones prediction for the Merc gap at the end? 20/30+?
I miss the Toro Rosso livery but this is one of the best looking grids in a while.
"Grosjean spinning, Ricciardo DNF, Merc 1-2... some things never change"
"It's 2014 all over again. Ferrari are midfielders, Red Bull are second best with unreliability, and Mercedes are way too good to the detriment of the sport"
Mercedes worried about sensor issues on RP
Bottas is fucked. He is getting a Hamilton special like Rosberg did in 16
"Ham is winning this, isn't he?"
In about 45 laps we’ll hear ”GET IN THERE LEWIS”
"Mercedes telling Hamilton to look after his car after the RP retires...

Surely they’re not...the same car"
Lol magnussen
Brake issues?
Renault engine also sounds like is screaming for help.
Magnussen keeping it interesting for the fans
Literally forgot to brake.
Mercedes sweet double stacking.
I vote Bernd Maylander for Driver of the Day
"Merc domination, Ferrari underdelivering, my boys Haas in shambles, it's like we never took a break"
Kimi just pitted. This fucked his strategy I think.
"Not heard it for a long time, here it is ""BOX BOX BOX!"""""
That's gonna be an investigation...
Mercedes with their brilliant double stack
Lewis is going to win isn’t he
Perez with mediums????
Will never get tired of watching a flawless Mercedes double stack
Bottas sweating bullets in his car right now
Lmao if there’s any more retirements Williams have an excellent chance of points
"Perez on new medium tyres, everyone else on hards."
[deleted]
Come on Albon. Need a big boi move off the restart
Kimi was bonded to points. Sure his pace was better than Ocon and Magnussen and the idea was to undercut them. The luck of this guy is unbelievable. Some things never change.
Surprised by the mediums on Perez
"If we just accept both mercedes are going to check out every race, we can probably enjoy a hard fought F1 season."
DAS USAGE
"The FIA should have access to the onboard cameras, it shouldn't be down to FOM releasing the footage"
Can't wait for Drive to Suvive Season 3
I think we can officially say Ferrari are F1.5
How come that Haas suffers from braking issues for 5 years or so?
if Ferrari somehow get 3-4 lets just count it as 1-2 okay?
"So, Ferrari pitstop faking sTrAgEgY actually worked in their favor?? 2020 works in wonders"
Is Bottas' front right tyre damaged?
Deploying DAS is like a Sith showing off Force Lightning
The old Vettle spin
"VETTEL SPIIIIN

I'm getting a full bingo card today"
Ugggh love Seb but that was clumsy
END MY SUFFERING
Nah no way
"Ahhhh Vettel spinning,  like 2019!"
"Ah, seb, always with your spins"
Vettel spins. Formula 1 popping off
Ambitious but rubbish.
What are you doing Vettel.
No memes no memes
Now that’s a symbolic crash
"Vettel, what a terrible attempt at a pass. 

Amateur mistake, I'm sorry to say."
"Death, taxes and Vettel spins"
Vettel spins and Latifi is still last.
THEY TOUCHED MARTIN
Ferrari are just a high budget Haas
"Why, Seb, why"
THEY TOUCHED MARTIN
Vettel memes incoming
Alphamaxnova1 incoming
Is Latifi driving a tractor?
Love how Vettel literaly spun it DIRECTLY after the Safety Car and somehow Latifi is still behind him...
Hello darkness my old friend.
"The mic seems in the wrong spot in Leclerc's car, it sounds as in a box"
No way checos mediums are going to the end right?
Every retirement pushing George closer and closer to points 👀
Seeing a Ferrari being sandwiched by 2 McLarens is not what I expected to see today if you asked me about this 4 months ago
ESPN just showed Leclerc’s onboard. Why does the audio sound like a 144p YouTube video?
Grosjean black and white flagged...
f1 tv is a bunch of wankers
"Mercs clash, and Albon wins. Do it race gods"
Seb‘s head already in retirement. Can‘t blame him.
Should just let Hamilton and Bottas race until one of their engines explode
Virtual mirror :D
That backwards cam is nice
That ferrari sounds awful
WILLIAMS ALMOST IN THE POINTS
LETS GO RUSSELL
Let’s go George. Get a point boy
Latifi is so far behind George.
"""leclerc is the meat in a mclaren sandwich"" please, this is a family friendly program"
Leclerc is the meat in the McLaren sandwich 😏
I’m already annoyed by the spinna memes and I haven’t even seen one yet
George Russell in 12th right now. Dude can pass gio and ocon. Let’s go!
"Ocon onboard sound like a jet taking off, is it the mic?"
Russell 12th though!
There has to be something on Vettel's setup that makes the car spin on almost every contact right?
renault onboard mic sounding like a blender
Russell 2 seconds away from the points...
Great call by Force India to put on the mediums
We 2016 now bois
"Really depressing how Leclerc is just nowhere, he’s just not catching up at all"
Radio for Bottas - Urgent chassis default 2 1
Sensor issues on both Mercs? Spicey
There you go - both drivers got the message
Man the Mercs look like 2 tie fighters. I love that black livery
Inb4 sensor issues screw both cars and we have Albon win
"Bottas really wants the win, still on the kerbs."
I would love to see what the 18 non-Mercedes cars are doing...
"Love a +9second third place...

Zzzzzzz"
Lol they don't want to stay off the curbs to give the other an advantage.
"""But Toto, Valtteri is doing it more"""
Reminds me of Silverstone 2014 where Alonso was listing off every corner where Vettel was going off the track haha
"Merc pits: STAY OFF THE CURBS!!

Merc drivers: What are curbs?"
Please god let the mercs retire
"The renault engine sounds completely insane, every time they go onboard with Ocon I keep thinking something is going wrong with the engine."
Great to see Russel holding his position.
"***Valtteri, it’s James***"
FIA having Austria fix up the curbs now
Damn when James comes on you know they aren't kidding
"Valterri it’s JameS
*drink*"
Oh hi James
sooo... is that Robottas.exe V2.1 or 3.0?
Looks like team orders until the end for the Mercedes.
"Please stay on the kerbs, please stay on the kerbs, plaese stay on the kerbs"
To both drivers: instruction to use as much kerb as possible to shock the sensor to the default setting. Repeat: instruction to use as much kerb as possible to shock the sensor to the default setting.
DON'T GIVE ME HOPE!
YAS .  team orders.. sunday drive is boring  MERC please explode that gearbox.
“EVEN BADDER”
[deleted]
"Everything is critical, the car is basically dying. Still +10 sec tho. What a car man..."
"Setting purple times when staying off the kerbs with the engines turned down

Just Mercedes things"
"""They're still 10 seconds a lap clear""  
  
I'm sorry?"
RACE DIRECTOR PLS
Can the director please show something besides the two Mercs??
Has Vettel got problems? Why can't he pass?
Why don't they show interval instead off gap to leader. Interval is much better
What is this?! Showing a midfield battle!
Fucking hell Grosjean. This has to be his last season ffs
Lol I think Brundle thought that Vettel was a Mercedes
COVER THE MIDFIELD!!!! YOU MOTHER FUCKERS!!!
"Vettel in a heated race with Russell! Come on director, show us were the real action is, will Vettel break into the top 12 before his car blows the engine, fans need to know!

EDIT: Russell doing the needful"
Grosjean out for a Sunday drive it seems...
Haas are fucked. So fucked
Grosjean caught again doing Grosjean things
Grosjean just chilling
Russell :(((
Russell noo fuck
SAFETY CAR HERE WE GO
"This race is cursed.

EDIT: or blessed?"
" Somehow we’re back to 2016 again. More Perez, Norris and Leclerc please."
This amount of retirements is so 1990s
george your sacrifice will be remembered
Taking bets on who will actually finish this race?
Now at the restart we see if there genuinely were sensor issues or if it was just Mercedes way of making them hold station without argument.
"Haas just sending their drivers out without brakes, a bold strategy"
"So... Ferrari slow and reliable, Mercedes fast and unreliable..?"
Grojean taking the scenic route I see. Good for him to take in the sights.
This race has been a freaking ride
"At this rate, Latifi is gonna get a juicy point (if he can finish)"
Perez stayed out on those meds??
At this rate you'll get points just by finishing
Albon is gonna win this race wow
[removed]
Did crofty just go bwoah
mercedes gonna have no issues keeping in front here lets be real
Albon win? Please let this happen
Let's all thank Williams and George Russell for their sacrifice
Albon tyres only 4 laps old.
The secret spot has been found
Hahaha those fans! LOVE THEM
Mercedes 1-2-3 right now.
So Merc 1-2-3 now
Toto slap a desk!
Albon might do a Ricciardo in China 2018?
The fuck McLaren done to Sainz?
"Wow they still found a way to show the “crowd”, race director must have soiled their pants when they found that"
Pretty bonkers race
Noooooo Kimiii....
WTFFFFFFFFF
Lmaooooo we made it two turns
Oiii Alfa is gonna get spanked
LATIFI POINTS???
What is this race?????
BULLSHIT ALEX HAD THAT PLACE
"13 cars left. Fucking hell. 

Did Kimi pit during the SC or what?!"
The meme race
Tyre came off dafuq
wtf that was so dangerous. No tether!
What a fucking season opener
"""Steering wheel steering wheel""  sorry just the wheel"
Someone dint screw the bolt properly
mmm this race is a bloodbath
HUNGER GAMES: AUSTRIA EDITION
Shouldn't Albon have the 3rd back?
Latifi is taking the williams far!
"I was sort of joking when I said this was like Le Mans earlier but damn that's 7 cars already, with Hamilton and Bottas both ignoring the curb avoidance order. When was the last time we lost half the pack?"
"Wow, that tire just peaced out"
F1 clearly can't have such long breaks or else everyone forgets how to do anything.
"~~Don't like the tether fucking up~~, but risks of them doing so is in part why we have a halo."
“No Kimi you will NOT have the wheel”
"Tyre: I must go, my planet needs me"
What the fuck is going on this race?? 2020 shaping up to be the most exciting in years
Points for Latifi?
2020's shitshow has permeated F1's season REALLY fast
"Thand hand gesture from Kimi: ""where did my wheel go?"""
"Just two more retirements Austria, please."
That's got to be a team penalty. It's comical because nobody got hurt but a tire like that is very dangerous and inexcusable
Latifi in 12th! Absolute scenes if Russell again gets beat by his teammate in points
These SC is really hurting Mclaren with the M
This race is great
GIVE ALB P3
Latifi is salivating now lol
Kimi got the steering wheel but not the other kind of wheel.
Schumacher would have carried on
Imagine if Latifi gets points before Russel lol
When was the last time we had this many retirements?
Does anyone else think that big “end racism” sign on the building looks like “2nd racism”?
Alfa overalls are sick
This actually might help Albon. Even less laps on the softs.
I guess Ferrari are at least reliably slow
"Quote of the day for me ""there's a wheel nut at large"" lmao"
Seb probably will get into points because of the shitshow
F1 is the only sport where we get 473910 million replays from equally different angles for the same accident.
Seb gonna end up back in the points somehow haha
Mercedes again with the perfect strategy of staying the fuck away from the kerbs.
What is this filter on these onboard retirement flashbacks
That’s going to be meme’d to hell
Kimi’s wheel just straight up bounced. “I’m out”
"So are they not giving Albon that place? He was ahead of Perez when the SC flag came out, right?"
13 cars in track and Vettel is 11. lmao
ALBON 3 I WILL CREAM MY PANTS
Yes! Alex recovers the position
Safety car was longer on the track than Verstappen
Albon please just bring this home
There we go Albon got his spot. Now we can chill guys
Albon 3rd boys lets fucking go
The scenes if Latifi gets a point and Russel still hasn't.
7 retirements and sebs still might only get 1 point.
10 lap shootout
Huge points possibility for McLaren here
This is like the opening races when I was growing up. Just random disasters all over the place
Latifi gonna get his first point before George RIP
HAMILTON ON ALBON AGAIN
Nooooooo alex
Noooo come on
Albon and Hamilton... shit
holy fuck albon has the worst luck
ALBON NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Fuuuuuuuck
Ah Jesus Albon
"I jinxed it I am so sorry :(

Fucking damnit"
Fucking Lewis.
Not again :(
Latifi point inbound
DEJA VU
Nooooooooooooooo
Albon!!!
Fuck right off.
NOOOOO ALOBONOOOOO
Vettel in the points lol
I'm hoping Perez and Norris can get 2-3.
Let's hope both merc gearboxs breakdown tbh
I think Hamilton sold his soul how is he this lucky every time??????
Alex was ahead.
"Stewards when they see Christian Horner now: ""Oh god oh fuck"""
IMMM SO FUCKING DONE
Sainz Leclerc was super clean
"Although this has been full of some absolute heartbreak. I gotta say, this is an exciting first race back."
Leclerc is amazing
A Ferrari podium would sum this up nicely haha
"""LECLERC IS PASSING SAINZ!""

""The Ferrari is unquestionably better on hard tyres""

What the hell is this commentary? It's Norris and he's on mediums."
"After everything that has happened in the build up and during this race, how the hell are Ferrari in a position to get a podium?"
"Ooh, I do like the halo HUD Graphics"
COME ON CHARLES
OH FUCK THEY DID IT.
Divebomb from banana boi
Hahahah Ferrari second.
Imagine if this happens every race and this mini-season ends up being one of the greatest of all time
Leclerc is really gonna get second in that Ferrari hahaha
All according to the Ferrari master plan
This race is what I needed
Vettel out of the points with half the field retired SMH
Just wanted to say I LOVE F1
Hamilton with a penalty. He's after fucking albon out of two podiums now. Poor kid.
HOLY FUCK FERRARI MIGHT GET SECOND PLACE!!!! WHAT THE FUCK
How in the FUCK has Ferrari sneaked their way into a possible 2nd???
WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON LMAO
"Lando, you need to fucking send it now."
You can’t make this shit up
MY GOD this race is CRAZY love it!
Toto: Kill RBR in the WCC for +5s penalty? Worth.
Latifi is 11th omds
 This is chaos!
"All these action to make up for the 217 day drought. 


KEEP IT COMINGGGG"
Lol only one left for all points
Will 10 cars finish?
NORRIS PODIUM LETS GOOOOOOOO
LATIFI GET INTO THE POINTS CHALLENGE 2K20
watch latifi be the only person not getting a point lmao
F1 or demolition derby?
WHAT A LAP NORRIS
Come on Lando!!!!!
LANDOOOOOOOO
NORRIS PODIUM MY MAN
Landoooooooooo!!!!
Lando legendary lapp
Lando made it no????
NORRIS YOU MAD LAD
McLaren podium! What a start!
LANDOOOOOO
Lando Yes
OMG how did that race finish lol
Lando YEEEEEEEEESSSSSS!!!!!!!
NORRIS PODIUM HOKRJRJEJurjrudnskahH-_#<>#>#*#
Broadcasting graphics confusing
STREAMER PODIUM
Lando driver of the day
What a fucking season opener
LANDOOOOOO
McLaren podium!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lando baby!!!!
LANDOOOOOooOoOOOOOOoO!
Lando!!! The mad lad did it
LANDOOOOOOOOO
WHAT A RACE LADS
McLaren's second podium in three races
Never thought Ferrari would get on the podium
Yes Lando! So happy!
This is the first time since Australia 2015 where there are only 11 race finishers
What a race Mclaren. Meme lord on the podium for a meme race.
Zak Brown just got a lot of weight off his shoulders
Last two Mclaren podium came due to Lewis punting Albon and getting 5s penalty lol
Landoooooooo!!!!
Lando *BLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP* Norris
"Gratz Landooooo, Albon died for this. F"
LOL lando hitting the 3rd place marker
A Twitch streamer got a F1 Podium!!!!
WELCOME TO 2020 F1
Is this a fan video on that screen? Ffs liberty..
Yo wtf was that
Lando you legend! Feel for Alex Albon though.
"Not bad for Ferrari at all, considering quali and practice."
"What a way to start the season.... A race fitting to start the year after such a long gap.

Ferrari doing a reverse Ferrari and ending at 2nd place amidst all the chaos. 

Happy for Lando but poor Albon can't catch a break."
 ABSOLUTELY BLESSED RESULT
LANDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Austria always seems to deliver a good race
"MY BOY HAS BECOME A MAN!!!!! 

Next year, we may see Lando, Ric 1-2 podiums!"
LANDOOOOO
Austria painted orange and not the kind of orange people thought before Australia .
IT'S NICE TO BE BACK BOYS
Should’ve been Albon on the podium though 😭
Lewis so disappointed to be getting out at parc ferme with the rest of the normies.
"Absolute shitshow of a Ferrari comes 2nd, but I'm almost more hyped about Lando."
wtf was that tv screen. Was that real or edit in? It looked really fake to me
"LANDOOOOOOOOO NORRIS AHAHAHA HOW DID HE GET A PODIUM, WHAT A WEIRD RACE"
Guys this is unbelievable. Best day ever
That mask ain't covering your nose my dude
Holy shit what a race. Great start to the season
"22,000+ comments.  Welcome back F1."
"HOLY SHIT LANDOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!

AND OH MY GOD THE FERRARI IS ON THE PODIUM!"
Hat guy's nose is exposed
Sat here in a bright orange McLaren shirt jumping with joy for that Lando podium
Man I'm out of breath. That was insane
Where the FUCK did Ferrari come from?
LANDOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
The top 3 drivers drove really well today. A very deserving podium.
Props to Lando. Leclerc also wrangled that shitbox to a P2. Impressive
Its fucking Baku
I hope Valterri keeps this form throughout the season. We deserve a good fight between the Mercs as they run away from the pack.
Increíble Norris.
This time next week ladies and gents?
Mclaren socially distancing in their own way
Somebody needs to tell these guys that it’s not against the rules to finish the entire race.
LANDOOOOOOO
LANDO LOSING IT
"Lando must have had someone in his ear for that last lap, pulled a belter out of seemingly nowhere"
"Looking at the side angle replay, Hamilton wasn't even near the white line at point of contact, so there was tarmac, white line, red and white kerb and green concrete to the left of him.

Contact happened when both cars were still on the tarmac. But there wasn't space?"
Not a bad finish from the professional streamer
"Fuck outta here Crofty, Getting spun by Lewis twice is no consolation for what should be podiums. Drivers don't race to look back at the times they were wheel to wheel with WDC."
"I'm not sure I agree with Brundle calling for patience for Albon. 

Legitimate move, very clumsy by Hamilton."
"Ferraris are red, Red Bulls are Blue, no matter what you do, mercedes 1-2"
Anddd it’s back to a merc 1-2 sighhhh
Every non Merc car is a fucking joke
"Give me a vintage F1 race with half the field retiring, racing gods, please - and maybe a Merc breakdown too?"
Incredibly unsafe release
At this point Vettel is doing it just for us.
s🅱️in se🅱️
fuck i forgot the new regulations were pushed to 2022. I'm depressed now guys
Latifi is awful. Jesus....
Inb4 mercs take each other out.
"\-Critical problems 

\-Half a second faster than Albon"
Albon going to win this race
How is Merc this lucky all the fucking time
"Kimi, you will not have the tyre. You will not have the tyre."
Fuck this. Fuck Mercedes.
That's Hamilton's fault. Albon had the lead.
PENALTY TO HAM OR WE RIOT!!
"how can you put that on Albon, he had two thirds of a car length around the outside. Apparently you should never go for an overtake or you are reckless."
Girlfriend got pissed at me because I yelled “HE DID IT AGAIN” poor Albon should’ve been patient but he had him beat.
Bullshit slap on the wrist for Hamilton.
5s when he murdered Albon's dreams...
5 seconds? You took someone out of the race
"Also, unbelievable race from Leclerc to bring the 5th fastest car home 2nd."
What an emotional rollercoaster. From heartbreak because of Stroll and Albon to jubilation because of my boy Lando. I enjoyed this.
"""But Mom, Valtteri is driving much more dangerously than me!"""
If anyone is at fault there it's Hamilton
Torpedo Hamilton fucking up another podium chance for my boi Albon >:-(
Fucking Hamilton again.
"And here we go, Mercedes 1-2 in 12 laps. Fucking joke"
S P I N N A L A
"Merc 1 and 2, VER and RIC breaking down. Seb spinning. It's good to be back"
Lewis fault again.
I respect Brundle but he needs to remove the Union Jack from his eyes before he watched these incidents
"I don't get it, why is it so hard for people to use the mask *over* the nose??"
"LMAO at that helicopter flip!  Red Bull is like ""We've missed putting on a spectacle at multiple GPs this season so fuck it pull out all the stops and yank out the cool shit!"".  I love them so much."
lol cancel the season
That's a definite Merc 1-2 then... Yawn.
"Me: Yes! F1 is back!!!

Me after 3 laps: yeah I had my fill."
Inb4 only Ferrari built a working car and win after all others retire
Ferrari may have the worse engine but at least it is not giving up lmao
"As much as F1 changes it still stays the same. Max and Daniel dnf with a Merc 1,2"
Has anyone had worse luck with mechanical issues than Danny Ric? It feels like half his races end in DNF with mechanical issues
That was Vettel's fault lmao
[deleted]
‘But mummmm he’s doing it too’
F1 drivers are worse than teenage girls at staying off of curbs
LOL Lewis you damn dibber dobber
Lewis a snitch
"SOMEBODY QUICK!

TELL FOM, THERE ARE 14 OTHER CARS DOING AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT RACE ON THE SAME CIRCUIT, WATCH OUT OR THEY MIGHT ACCIDENTALLY FILM THEM"
Mercs definition of critical os win by 10 seconds instead of 20
Petition to put the nastiest fucking curbs possible on every track
Mercedes engineers are bluffing about sensor issues. They just want a 1-2. Calling it now.
Albon-Norris-Perez. Trust me I'm from the future.
GET OUT OF THE GODDAMN WAY CHECO. please
Get that fuckin SC off already
Hamilton you DOG
"Give Hamilton a penalty, I wanna see Norris on the podium.

And don't do it after the race."
ONLY 5 SECONDS? HE RUINED ALBON'S RACE FFS
HOW CAN THE FERRARI FIT LECLERC HUMONGOUS BALLS????
"Perez speeds in the pit lane - 5 second penalty.

Hamilton hits Albon off the track and completely  ruins his race - 5 second penalty. 

Sounds legit"
IM FUCKING CUMMING LETS GO LANDOOOOOO
I HAVE BEEN ENTERTAINED!
Mercedes played themselves by not switching positions straight away after getting the penalty. Ferrari like strategy there.
Bruh how did Charles drag that shitbox into P2
Leclerc second is such a feat
"Poor Albon, he could have won this one, but I loved this race. Weekend cant get enough soon"
Something about that felt awkward as fuck.
That flag fly-over was SO Red Bull.
"First time F1TV user. I expected nothing and I am already annoyed!

Also, RTL presentator calling a B-25 Mitchell a ""D10""...ok."
Mercedes are so dominant they are even allowed to use the main feed as free advertising
"Did not know you could loop the loop in a helicopter, until now. God I’ve missed F1."
"Imagine inverting in a plane. 

Now in a chopper. 

Holy fuck. What a set of balls on that pilot."
can Bottas win please? Just to mix up a bit..
Hamilton will be P2 in 3 laps.
"F1 TV Roku App working here. Live race had an error, switched to pit lane, then back and it started"
I love Zak Brown
F1TV is working for me now. I hope this isn't temporary...
"Excited to have F1 back, this is my first ""full season"" of F1. Got interested after playing F1 2019"
I don’t think I’ve been this excited in months. I hope it’s a shitshow
Anyone can share pirate streams? F1 TV is down
RIP to everyone relying on F1TV to watch the race. You'll be with us in spirit.
"Fuck F1TV

that is all"
HYPE MUSIC
Thank god I made sure to buy an F1 TV subscription and ended up watching on an illegal Sky Sports stream lmao.
Anyone else kinda glad they wont be able to cut to the crowd constantly?
Wonder if F1TV is overloaded
First race with F1 TV and I can't watch anything.  What a fucking joke.
f1tv broken again for everyone?
"Now the entire f1 tv website and app is down 

Fuck me."
"I just want to say, fuck F1 TV. What a waste of money. Can't even watch the first race of the season."
I'm pulling for Lando Norris.
F1TV is a fucking joke
is the F1 TV stream not loading for anyone else?
Is f1tv not working?
"Pff, F1TV is so shit"
Has F1 TY ever worked for anyone ever?
Knowing our luck this year an asteroid is about to hit Spielberg.
"Anybody have any luck with refunds for F1 TV? 

I decided to begin using their service as a thank you for all the classic races I saw over the last couple months. I figured the app would be fixed since it's been... how many years?

Going back to pirating. 

Formula 1 is Ferrari levels of embarassing."
"How can F1 TV be this fucking bad. Race is back for the first time in ages and they fuck it up, way to kill my hype."
F1TV has been furloughed
Bottas has completely checked out. This Merc is nuts
"""Look after the car""

Bottas: ""YEET"""
Holy hell bottas just cruised away
Bottas has just fucked off
this is ridiculous.. I'm literally paying for shitty fucking service
Bottas is fucking gone. Ferrari struggling to get out of the midfield. Lando staying up front. It's already been worth the wait.
Nooo McLaren race pace bad ☹️
Ah yes TV director already missing key moments. It's like we never left 2019
sure would be cool if F1TV would work...
"McLaren : ""We'd love to be fighting the Ferraris this year.""

Also McLaren : ""This isn't what we meant."""
Lets show a replay instead of ham overtaking norris.
My hopes of Lando on the podium have quickly faded
Albon is my favorite character in Drive to Survive tbh
Racing Point to announce that they've changed their fuel mixture to a combination of deviled eggs and lager.
F1tv not working. How is this possible? You had three years and this season you had at least 6 months to work on your software.
F1TV IS DOOOOOWNNN!
Can we get an investigation on these smoking Mercedes engines?
Alex doing a good job here!
How is Formula 1.5 working this year? Is just Mercedes and Red Bull now? Is Ferrari officially a mid field team?
Hamilton is playing on easy mode
what a drs pass there amazing
F1 TV works like a charm again.. ^/^s
It could also be that the Merc is just fucking fast.  It's not like everybody else is just easily making passes because of three DRS zones.
albon pstd rn
Hamilton: I am... inevitable
Martin making even more statements I agree with. Why DOES this tiny track have 3 DRS zones?
NOOOOOOOOOOOO MAX
"Oops, the RBR caught COVID..."
RED BULL NOT AGAIN
"The engine fucking stopped, jesus"
"GP2 engine, GP2 engine lmao"
"Random DNFs have been a weirdly frequent feature of the entire weekend across the support catagories

Gremlins seeping in after so long away?"
I enjoy the optimism of rocking your head forwards to make the car go.
"How does this always friggin happen. Merc 1,2 as God intends it to be"
"Lmao, F1 is truly back"
Congrats Mercedes on another constructer championship.
Fuck me. End this season
"So sad, was looking forward to a lewis vs max battle :("
Talk about being anti climatic lol
"WHAT IS MORE BROKEN: FERRARI, F1TV OR VERSTAPPENS RED BULL"
Oh jeez netflix is loving this
Red Bull now going to protest their own car.
Podium for lando. We can do it bois
Boring Merc 1 and 2. Gotta say tho the black Livery looks so clean.
Mercedes 1-2 :(
"I'm done too, Max.. :("
Red Bull won the race by retiring first. So sad.
I had a good feeling about Max strategy as well 😣
So... give Albon the better wing during his pit?
and just like that I don't give a shit about this race.  fuck Merc 1-2s
It would be cool if Merc had some gremlins. An ALB-NOR-PER podium would be legendary.
"But hey, RP vs McLaren vs Ferrari looks interesting"
Wow unlucky for Max.
F1 cant ignore its destiny. Mercedes 1-2 will find u
Hamilton killed Max car for not kneeling /s
Stroll has „no power“ and Vettel still can’t get past. Please end my suffering
Thought ferrari was actually catching pink merc. Turns out stroll has a problem lol
Swears in Australian
"Oh fuck me, Danny looks like he's heading out now."
Well at least I can be in bed before midnight.. Ffs renault
lmao cars dying left and right
8 races is long enough this season
"A lot of Cars Brake down, so there is actually a chance for Ferrari :D"
"Two teammates pass each other

Martin: *SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING*"
Red Bull 2018 in tatters.
"mercedes will want to go to the lowest power modes I expect, save the 1 /2 . no hamilton vs bottas...."
Feels like the Red Bull golden years with Max and Dan retiring within laps of each other.
Stroll about to retire. Hes got huge power loss.
"Death, taxes, mercedes 1-2"
German Sky commentators sound exactly how I feel about this season. Sad and depressed
Only thing that can save this seaaon this way is an engine problem also for Bottas and Hamilton
"Renault and reliability is a terrific pair, they go together like lamb and tuna fish."
Ferrari's strategic brilliance strikes again: make everyone ruin their engines in qualifying.
"So Merc 1-2 is pretty much settled, unless mechanical issue.  
The battle from 4th to 8th is interesting tho"
Only thing keeping me sane at this point is a possibility of an Albon podium
Ouch... Latifi is over half a second slower than Russell.
This just shows that Verstappen is one of the only exciting parts of formula 1 at the moment.
Will half the field finish?
Wow. That's three cars now.
Can't honestly remember this many drivers retiring from PU issues this early
Grosjean is useless. Lost it on his own again
Shit that's three retirements now. What the hell?
This race is becoming more like reliability issues.
Almost a 1/5 of the grid is out already...
I think Haas drivers like to piss off their team principal who has a short fuse.
Trickery from Ferrari lol
Love how Martin is tracking where Ferrari is to Mercedes in terms of pit stops. He is dreaming
who are ferrari trying to fake out? racing point? lmao
The old clean air dummy stop. Classic.
"Sainz is killing away from one Ferrari and catching up to the another, lol"
Vettel driving WEC
"According to Sky, Grosjean is on Hard Wet tires"
How does Mercedes know the specifics of the Racing Point issue?
This season is gonna be a walk in the park for Hamilton. Might as well just hand him the championship now.
Bottas just had a shocker of a lap lost a second
Tires on curb go brrrrrrr
"Honda failed, Renault failed, Mercedes failed. Ferrari best engine confirmed!"
Williams so slow their engines stay cool. Only cars to finish the race... Absolute masterstroke Williams 1 - 2
Renault engine is literally ear-rape
[deleted]
Lmao what was that?
I'd go deaf sitting in that Renault
"How the fuck did Magnussen manage to- wait, brake failure?"
Bunch of wankers
I think K-Mags brakes just died
Magnussen be like: Player left the session.
i see we're crossing off every square of mechanical issues bingo today
"A brake issue on a car is fucked

Mag needs to fock smash some doors"
Not the 1st race I was hoping for.
"Haas and braking issues, a perfect couple"
Even if Max didn’t retire this safety car would have ruined his strategy
Safety car to spice shit up!  Awww yeah!    Norris - lets do this!   Or Albon.
Williams in the points at this rate?
"Jesus, I can’t imagine how scary a front brake failure would be in an F1 car at full speed."
That was a cool spin though by KMag.
MAG keeping it out of the gravel was pretty smooth though
unsafe release incoming
Round of applause to Mercs pit stops there.
That Mercedes double-stop. Chef’s kiss incredible
"2.8 & 2.5, just Mercedes things"
That looked so much better on the onboard than it did from the other view. *Might* escape a penalty.
"YOOOO I dont care what anyone says even with Mercedes dominance, F1 is super entertaining."
"The release looked pretty clearly unsafe, even if Perez managed it well."
Shouldnt that be a penalty for unsafe release?
Plz merc let bottas race and dont just let ham go past
Was hoping Vettel would make a place or two with the different strategy but now it is unlikely
"Wow great, cut away from Lando's onboard replay to a shot of the SC cruising up the hill"
Russell 13th lads. Lets go
This is not the race i want.
"Perez on medium, we have a gambler 👀"
Feels bad for Kimi
Russell P13 let’s go
KMag's front right brake Haas failed
"Lewis will take a second place over a potential DNF any day.

He's only going to make a move if he has a clear run."
Are Valtteri’s tires blistering already?
Breaking News: Latifi is last again
Crofty telling Ted to get the fuck on with it. You love to see it.
ALBON ON HIS WAY TO HIS FIRST PODIUM
Fucking Vettel
SBINALLLAAA
"Vettel FFS, FFS"
Cue the memes
HES FONE FOR A SPIN NOT AGAIN
Vettel doing his customary spin
God damn
Oh my God he's done it again
"Say it, say the word"
Vettel loves a spin
Lol vettel
IM ALMOST DONE MY BINGO BOOK
Laughs in alphamaxvo
That was so obvious. Hahahah
Fuck my life here we go
Waited 7 months for a race and now I'm turning off the tv after 20 minutes. Great
The Vettel memes just write themselves
Vettel being clumsy again
Looks to me like Seb was already spinning
Vettel wtf?
Sbinnnnnn
Vettel on suicide watch
Vettel spins. F1 is back. Everything is normal again.
Come on Vettel there was no space there...
Pretty sure Leclerc pushed Sainz a bit on the straight before that. Getting spicy before they are even teammates
"Perez and Norris incident has been noted by the stewards
Vettel and Sainz incident has been noted by the stewards"
"My god, Seb's radio was just depressing there."
Come on Russel!
George in P12!?!?’
"Dude Seb come on man, no excuses for that"
That pink Mercedes is bloody quick. Wonder if he can get Albon?
"Sainz “the future is now, old man”"
"Renault doing Renault things,
Grosjean doing Grosjean things,
Vettel doing Vettel things. 
And we aren't even half way yet, welcome back F1"
Bruh how is latifi already 13 seconds behind the next car
The onboard of leclerc sounds like a toy car with a speaker in I had as a kid
Latifi seems to be out for a Sunday drive. He's losing like a second a lap.
This season is really going to suck isnt it
How can Latifi already be over 12 seconds behind the car in front after a few laps from a safety? That's piss poor. Or did something happen that we never got to see?
Is it just a mic thing that the ferrari onboard sounds so much much more muted as opposed to the merc and honda engines?
Maybe it's just the 7 month gap but I'l really enjoying this race. Close midfield battle for P4/maybe P3 and the two Mercs are gonna have it out for the win.
Checo wants to prove something today!
"Sandbagging in the race itself, big brain time"
"Damn, this could be a Mercedes 1-2-3!"
Can Mercedes just run on lower power full time please.
"Damn, Russell’s in 12th"
Charles is stuck in a McSandwich.
Yo that rearview camera is super cool
"Mercedes 1-2, Vettel spins out, Renault & Red Bull mechanical failures, Ferrari disappointing, Grosjean with unsportsmanlike conduct... nothing new to see here."
Grosjean getting a black flag would be the funniest shit ever
[deleted]
Ferrari sounds like it has a cold
Man this season will be awesome if just for the usual midfield drivers now fighting for podiums.
Show the battle for first....!
"I was excited tbh and to an extent I still am given McLaren’s improvement but the inevitability of Vettel spinning, Verstappen retiring and Bottas meekly letting Lewis dictate the race from behind is just depressing."
I hope it's the microphone but Ocon's engine does not sound healthy.
Renault sounds like a screaming cat
Renault's engine really does sound mental on Renault.
"Unless bottas has a massive fuck up, no chance Hamilton will overtake him."
this race is about to put me to sleep...
Plan A: go fast
"""Lewis doesn't want to get too close to Valtteri's gearbox.  They're both running very hot.  Lewis is launching an attack""

It almost reads like fanfiction"
Yeah cut to toto for no reason for fucks sake
mercedes 1-2 with 6+ seconds is too much flex
Don't break the fucking car.
Let’s see how brave Bottas really is
Hears “2-1” Hmmm thats suspect
Both Mercs blowing up would really make this a race.
Mercedes double retirement incoming
hamilton throwing the shade
This is going to be the most boring season yet. Mercedes is just gonna walk away with it.
They should really stop covering the leaders
"""Ted, be prepared to be interrupted""

""David, please, I know, this is my lif-""

""Two seconds Ted....."""
"JFC there are cars other than Merc on the track, you know."
God I can not for the life of me hear these radios
Imagine if we see both Mercs retire because they won’t stay off the curbs
"Mercedes are going slower in theory but still pulling away from the 3rd, that's incredible."
Just to be safe they should just retire both the Mercs
Vettel not getting close to the Williams?
"The tires must be amazing this year, I haven’t heard Hamilton say anything yet"
Merc: GUYS we REALLY MEAN IT this time
Gap between Albon and Bottas has officially passed 10 seconds... is there anyone out there who can even come close to the pace of the Mercs?
SENSORS DEAD POG
"No competition and Team Orders, fantastic!"
[deleted]
Getting told off by James
Sounds like a mommy is managing two babies..
Interesting that they share the status of the other car this direct
Lewis wasn't wrong Bottas isn't doing a good job taking care of the car
ALBON TAKE THOSE UNTOUCHED FUCKING CURBS
Lewis and Valtteri this is r/formula1 stay on the curbs
"Sucks cause Lewis was miles quicker today, but 2nd is better than retirement"
"Vettel chasing a williams, just like we all predicted"
Vettel is still 14th
Any word on PER unsafe release?
"""10 seconds a lap clear"" jesus christ that's a bit excessive"
"I'm happy for Mclaren, i'm happy for Racing point. What a tragedy for Ferrari tho, i cannot believe"
Critical issues and they’re 12 seconds ahead of the field. What the actual fuck
Did we just watch Mercedes for 8 laps
"I have a feeling Mercedes are fine, and just trying to make absolutely sure nothing goes wrong."
[deleted]
"I’m just realising that we have to do this all again next week

At the same track

Same cars

Oh god"
Its gonna be such an anticlimactic finish when they still get 1-2 with 10s ahead of Albon.
THEY HEARD US
[deleted]
honestly what are the odds this is just *Toto Mindgames*^TM
"Merc: Gearbox sensor issue critical.

Drivers: *Put another second on Albon.*"
"Haas left the working breaks back in the US, apparently."
"Death, taxes, Haas off-roading"
What a bunch of vankers.
Nooooo russell!!!!
Nooooo russel
"BONO, my sensors are gone"
Imagine sticking with Grosjean rather than taking the Hulk.......
Not Russel!
GEORGE NOOOOOOOOO!!!!
Nooooo not George :(
Retirements are being handed out like we are on Oprah
"""Romain, come in, Gene and Gunter want to swear at you for your spin earlier""

\*Grosjean wanders around the outside of the track looking for an exit\*"
"Race on, Merc will be allowed back on the curbs"
SC please please please please please please
The fact that vettel struggled to overtake a williams
RELIABILITY IS A YOKE! A YOKE
Now we find out if Merc was being honest about a problem or just playing team orders.
fuck we look like a bunch if fucking wankers
At this rate Latifi is gonna score a fucking point
I don't remember a race where this many cars have failed.
At this rate Latifi's going to be in the points
fuck yes finally some excitement
F1 cars out of shape after the break
If you told me 2 years ago that in 2020 in Austria we would see Kimi and Vettel battling ... I would believe you until you mentioned it was for 12th place and Kimi was in a Alfa.
No car finish? I'd like that
Cmon Albono
"Aw fuck, not George"
Albon and Norris on fresh tires looking good.
Albon on softs?
ALBON THIS IS ALL YOU BABY
"At the end of the race it’ll just be the Ferrari powered cars left, just like they planned."
Why Charles went for medium instead of soft? Did they use all of their softs?
"Watch these old hards, on detuned engined Mercs staying off the kerbs, STILL be faster than all those behind."
Rbr just fucked albon I think. Perez will not be easy to pass
WTF ARE YOU DOING SAINZ
"Albon softs, Perez mediums & both Mercs on very old hards.

This will be interesting."
Come on Alex !
ALBON SAVE OUR RACE
Safety car seemed like a gift for Perez on those mediums. Surprised he didn't pit.
COME ON ALBON YOU GOT THIS
I will riot if Lewis takes out Valtteri
"""Turn the engines back up to 11""

I dig the reference"
Will Ted be able to finish a sentence by the end of the race?
Sainz got fucked here. They shouldve double stacked
How has Haas still not figured out brakes. Like how. I've never seen a team struggle as much with brakes.
We have the best fans here
I hope Albon can win this now.
"The last time these two were fighting for position, Albon had to go onto the grass to overtake him. This should be fun"
༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ ALEX TAKE MY ENERGY ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
"6 cars out, this is almost Germany 2019 level stuff"
GO ALEX GO
What the hell happened to kimi?
FUCK SAKE KIMI
"Raikkonen in the wall on the main straight

Wheel came off...

Safety car deployed."
What the fuck alfa. Trying to kill kimi
"2020 keeps getting worse.

Instead of Mercedes 1-2 we've got Mercedes 1-2-3"
Safety car has more race time than Verstappen
Hopefully more than half of them finish ...
"That wheel was like ""I must go"""
"Oh my gosh, Kimi never had a chance"
That’s so scary with Kimi that. The view from Vettel is mad
The race looked like it was going to be good but it's fucked basically
Well you can’t say this race hasn’t been eventful haha
Hot mess of a race
Latiffi point coming
That was a short pleasure with the restart
How tf does the tire come off?
"If Latifi scores a point, I'm treating everyone to a nice sweet&sour chicken curry."
safety car driver of the day
Latifi is gonna end up in the points isn’t he
Wha... How... -.-
Felt bad for laughing
2 more retirements and Latifi (!) will score.
Vettel had to smash the gas to avoid the wheel coming back at him.
"7 cars out, all failures and no crashes"
"F1 car has issues: DNS/DNF/Struggles the entire race

Mercedes car has issues: 1-2 win, fastest lap, laps everyone"
This is a rather good race considering one team has such a pace advantage
Has anyone even had contact besides Vettel and Sainz? 😂
wow thats super dangerous stuff with the tyre...
"Now we just need one Merc, McLaren, Ferrari, and Alfa Tauri retirement each and we'll have one from each team"
Latifi could make some spicy memes today...
What the hell is happening here! Imagine if this was a wet race...
"C'mon Kimi nooooooo

He had a good chance for top 10 finish.

Arghh 

This race is amazing tho"
What a shitshow lol
Latifi does fuck all and gets at least 13th place.
The tire just wanted a drincc
See if Latifi survives long enough and gets williams yearly point to outscore Russell....
How many races we have this season.Out of the loop kind of for this season.
"I didn't see the ""replay"" in the top left and thought that was albon stalling and had a heart attack"
"Well that's the first time I've seen a wheel just ""come off"" like that."
"So many people getting chewed up and spat out by this track, goddamn..."
It's gonna end with a Mercedes top 4
"""I suspect there's a lugnut laying around somewhere around that track."""
Why didn’t Perez pit? Surely the mediums can’t last all the way
Perez still 3rd?
Damm so many reliability issues just like this year...
It makes sense that the first COVID era race is crazy
"I liked Kimi on this race. He was faster than the Haas, Gio and Ocon and I think he was on course to overtake Kvyat. Sadly this was a great chance to score points because the high amount of DNFs. It is what it is."
We’ve lost almost half the grid
Does anyone have the receipt? This race is broken and I would like a new one by next week.
I’m happy for AlphaTauri team. They have been doing pretty solid today.
Looks like that wheel nut might be embedded in the barriers or somewhere in the gravel.
Kimi my tyres are gon
Ah Albon back 3rd
"It says Perez's tyres are 2 laps old on the graphic along with everyone else.  He didn't pit though, did he?"
"Ooh Albon takes his place back.

Edit: he was allowed."
"That straight is clear

What they waiting for?!"
Austrian interviewer trying to ask Max what went wrong with the car was pretty hilarious. Basically asked him over and over again when Max clearly had no clue what the exact issue was.
I hope it pisses down
They should have turned damage off for this one.
Let's go Albon! Can he take the win?
Goddamnit every lap behind SC is good for Mercedes' gearboxes
Albon winning this would be poetic revenge of Brazil’19
Make those softs work Albon please.
"Binotto: ""Alright boys, we are in no shape to overtake a Fiat 500, so let's just keep on the track and hope everyone else fucks up"".

Claire Williams: ""Oi, that's MY strategy"""
Toto's table bracing for more action...
Vettel vs the Torpedo for the points. Going to be interesting.
"I know safety is number 1 priority but they need to address those excessive safety car laps, 3 laps have passed since they cleared the car"
Another Brazil
are you fucking kidding me
OF COURSE HAMILTON HAS NO DAMAGES
"Ham und Albon, wtf"
Wtf this race. Insane
It's not impatience if Lewis runs wide into him
One does not simply challenge Hamilton
Ffs not again...
Lewis is going to get slaughtered here
That was all on Hamilton you dipshit
Alex Nooooo
Was that self inflicted or did Hamilton do a naughty? Lets wait and see.
NOOOOOOOOOO ALEX NOOOOOOOO
deja-vu
"oh no, not again!"
Lap 62 of the fucking Hunger Games GP.
Perez survive please!
Albon must have done soemthing to Hamilton in the backstage . Holy shit
NOOOOOOOOOO
C'mon Lando
Can we just do 10x Austria this year through the seasons and weathers
Is Perez some kind of tyre god? His mediums are over 30 laps old.
"Fuck, we were in for a treat of a finish as well.."
"Oh, Ferrari is still in this race as well?"
"Seb spinning, Albon coming off worse against Lewis - script writers are a bunch of lazy bastards"
that is NORRIS Crofty
"Lewis's front wing is magnetically/romantically attracted to Albon's sidepods. 

Only theory I will accept"
*forgets to breathe*
Poor fucking Alex
Why can't they tell the difference b/w Lando and Sainz?
Where did this Ferrari speed came from
Ferrari fastest lap? Did Leclerc hit something and change aero to right settings?
"Such a shame Max retired with how this race panned out, and gutted for Alex, race was his to win."
It is pretty obvious that this needs to be a penalty.
there's the penalty finally
KARMA
How the fuck are we gonna get a Merc/Ferrari podium after this race
FERRARI IS 2ND WITH THAT SHITBOX CAR. THIS IS 2020 ALLRIGHT
5s Penalty for HAM
[me when Alex gets Hamiltoned. Again...](http://i.imgur.com/JGYSRXf.gif)
Race is finally coming alive.
Is Vettel driving a cow ?
WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?!?!
"God, imagine how dominant Leclerc will be if he gets a good car someday."
Checo needs to hurry to get his podium.
A Leclerc P2 would be a nice outcome after everything.
"c'mon Perez, stay with sub 5s of Lewis, c'mon Leclerc, let's give Perez 3rd :D  
  
Edit: strike that, 5 sec for Perez for speeding v.v"
"I’d take the penalty but man, Hamilton got the wayyyy better end of that for driving into Albion."
Checo time penalty!
This race is anarchy
"YOU GET A PENALTY, YOU GET A PENALTY, EVERYONE GETS A PENALTY!!"
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUIUUUCK
FUCKING TELL HIM PEREZ HAS A PENALTY JESUS MCLAREN
Let's go Lando
NORRIS YOU CAN DO IT MY MAN
LANDOOOOOOOOO YES
Wtf is going ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooon
What is this race?
WHAT IS THIS RACE
About to break out my abacus to figure out podium placements
Everyone seem to have forgotton how to drive. And the cars aswell
bruh 11 out of 20 WHAT IS THIS RACE
Oh my days. I am losing track of all this madness
"this was all calculated by latifi, slow and steady wins the race"
ONE MORE RETIREMENT AND THAT'S A POINT FOR LATIFI!!!
This feels like those virtual GPs we've been watching for months.
OMG PURPLE LANDO HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
YES NORRIS! FASTEST LAP!@!
"Tires exploding, tires coming off. These kerbs looks like the whomping willow."

"LET'S FUCKING GO MCLAREN AND NORRIS, YES, YES, FUCK YES!!"
Botta-Leclerc-Norris podium. Fuck me. There might be hope for this sport after all.
Leclerc fuck yesssss
I take everything back. Best race ever.
20 min Extended Highlights on YouTube pleade
LANDOOOO LMFAO
Same Norris
"What a crazy, crazy race! Good on you, Lando!"
Ferrari podium looks like a win for them
Imagine if Latifi finished in points lol That's all we were missing
MCLAREN
NOW THIS IS PODRACING!
LET'S FUCKING GOOOOO
"Wait, Landos PC didn't crash today?"
Get in there Lando
"Leclerc with 2 awesome moves and and norris with a great lap, just feel bad for the red bull boys"
"Mercedes-Ferrari-Mclaren, inject this to my vein"
LANDOLANDOLANDOLANDOLANDOLANDOLANDO
Be keen to see if it was Seb's contact that initiated that Kvyat puncture
LANDO LANDO LANDO!!
"Lol that graphic, so cringy"
A tractor just got second place in the 2020 Austrian Grand Prix....
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I LOVE YOU LANDOOOOOO
"That was a brilliant last few laps, so good to have F1 back"
Man mclaren are back
"GET IN ME VALTTERI 

wait"
McLaren happy to throw Carlos away at this pojnt
Such a sad day for redbull
What did i just witnessed
Loud squeaky Lando noises
That final lap of lando was mental!
Lando hit the P3 sign lmao go on
"Bottas P1, Leclerc saving that shitty car, Norris on podium. fuck me running, goddamn"
Can every race be like this
Too bad Norris doesn’t get the proper podium celebration
Great race a lot of stuff. 2nd SC helped a lot. Leclerc has to be happe for that lucky 2.
LANDOOOOOO
So happy for Lando but so gutted for Albon 😩
Norris third-youngest podium finisher ever.
"My dad went to bed at lap 50 lmaooooo thought it was gonna be boring, poor man"
"Ferrari be like: ""Guess I'll take it"" lmao"
NORRRRRRRIS!!
Social distancing is weird as fuck lol
"Fuck me, what a race"
"really happy for lando, and where did ferrari come from, lol"
my boy Vettel straight up gave up on Ferrari :(
HELL YEAH SO GOOD. Amazing to see Lando and McLaren on the podium
Did anyone even predict this in the 90-50-10. What a race! Incredible start to the season.
No point putting them up on the high podium if theres no crowd/dignitaries. This seems better.
WE ARE ALL FINNISH THIS EVENING!
What’s the point of this podium layout? They’re basically the same distance apart and they were all just standing right next to each other before
"i can not wait to hear lando on stream playing warzone with wildcat and courage hopefully he will talk about the race.

here is a previous stream clip
https://youtu.be/134Uhkppd7g"
Have we seen Albons onboard camera angle yet?
"Really prefer the team masks, the hospital style ones always creep me out"
Please god Mercedes crash together

Mercedes 1-2 just as god intended
Please overheat Merc and give Norris a podium
"Roses are red, 
Violets are blue,

Mercedes 1-2"
"Lmao at the people going ""Red Bull can't blame Renault now!"" 

Renault can though"
Come on Mercedes join the engine explosion grand prix. One can hope.
how is grosjean still employed?
VETTEL SPIN
Sbinella
SBINELLA!  FIRST OF THE SEASON!
Man fuck this shit honestly I can't even deal with the comments and memes that are going to happen in the next week
Alex holding third so well shows how much of a shame it was that Max had to retire
Please stop FOM the Ferrari engine is soooo awful to listen to
Seeing “aramco” and “end racism” side by side just irks me so much lol.
Valtteri it’s james
10 bucks says both the mercs will shit out gearboxes if they go on curbs more.
Can Vettel catch Russel? Things I didn't think I'd say.
Hahahaha group of people found the vantage point on the mountain
"""ight imma head out"" -wheel"
"Mercedes 40 laps long: critical sensor issue, will still finish 1-2..."
Mercedes has the luck of the devil again ffs
Albon has 3rd
"Lucky Hamilton, never critical damage"
Ham penalty incoming
"Albon was clearly ahead, no car widths space, if this isn't a Hamilton penalty then idk what is"
Hamilton has to get penalysed!
"As much as Alex deserves this podium, they should have told him about the gearbox issues. He could have waited and just licked his chops, knowing he would be free to use more track and equipment"
Leclerc is basically the new Alonso.
albon's sacrifice was not in vain. CONGRATS LANDO
"lmao who would have thought, ferrari on the podium!"
"Get the FUCK to work and give a winning-contender car to Charles.

There is nothing more to say about Ferrari."
It’s funny how most of the best teams have team color fabric masks while the others have disposable medical ones.
"""Pinnacle of motorsport""

Can't design cars that can handle some heat 

lol"
Charles is the real deal
GEARBOX FAILURES PLEASE LETS MAKE THIS RACE BLESSED
If Lewis isn’t penalized I swear
I think that's Ham's fault tbh. Albon was a mile ahead.
Hamilton should get a penalty for that.
Cars dropping out like they have COVID lmao
"Doesn't the champagne thing seem kind of dumb during COVID? They drink from the bottle, then spray everyone? Why wear a mask?"
#AlbonLivesMatter
"That was the best race I've seen in a long time.

My thoughts:

* Hamilton is still a shit and unfair driver. Albon should be on the podium AGAIN.
* Leclerc putting that Ferrari on podium is very impressive
* Those curbs are brutal
* Seb looks like he's having a difficult time in the car
* Ocon looked decent
* Albon had a great race, such a shame
* Latifi looked a bit out of place for me, I'd put it down to first race nerves, hope he gets better and takes the opportunity, standards have been set for rookie drivers now so he'll be compared to that now.
* Russell looked like he was having a strong race
* Haas looked a bit behind than what I was expecting. Very nice maneourver from KMag to retire the car safely without yeeting it
* AlphaT looked eh.
* Perez? Up and down for him. Very good drive with some costly mistakes. 
* Racing point looked seriously good, keep my eye on their car.
* Renault looked average, nothing much to say.
* LANDO FUCKING SENT IT! Very mature and solid drive.
* Max's issue is interesting, didn't RB and Honda work closely together for this engine/power unit? Would be interesting to find out more about what caused the issue.
* 7 safety cars?

Overall, such an exciting race,  one of the best I've seen in many years. I've missed F1 weekends and the race thread bants. 

See you all next week."
"""that's nothing to do with social distancing, he just doesn't want to speak to anybody"" 😂🤣😂"
"Mercedes 1-2 every race, thank god the season is short"
Shame to see Danny Ric start the season by retiring from his home race yet again.
"Are just waiting for James now? ""valteri you need to drive 7 sec slower for 1 lap""

""why?""

""Lewis needs to get in there"""
Force India literally just stole Mercedes 2019 car but somehow managed to forget that the car they stole had massive heating issues at this track last year lmao
"Death, Taxes, Vettel Spinning"
"Sure this will be downvoted, but that didn’t look like a dive bomb to me. Seemed like he closed in on the battling Leclerc and Sainz faster than he expected and had to squeeze the brakes down harder when he came to the side of a turning in Sainz. Still a clumsy move (should have expected a slower Sainz) but not a dive bomb gone wrong."
"Can we vote kick Mercedes?

Look at that Bottas pace"
Loving the empty grandstands and therefore the total lack of crowd shots so far.
"I must’ve missed it. Can someone tell me how Lewis started 5th? What was his penalty?

Edit: Woah so many responses in such a short time. Lol thank you everyone but if you saw one person answer correctly you all don’t have to comment the same thing lmao"
Austrians probably happy they couldn't buy tickets for this now
This drive to survive seasons gonna be lit at least.
"Ferrari: ‘Our car might be a shitbox, but at least it’s more reliable than some cars’"
Ricciardo's curse hasn't been broken yet. Can we get a Witcher or something
I didn’t know I was watching a race from 1985... what’s with this fucking reliability
Racing Point penalty incoming
Nicholas Latifi has improved 4 spots on his grid position
Spintel meme overcharge
Well that's the token Vettel spin of the season.
"I hate my life, why do I continue to watch this"
Ahh yess.... Vettel doing Maldonado type dive bombs... awesome shit
"O Vettel, that really was stupid. There was no gap there."
Russell in 12th. WILLIAMS POINTS PARTY?
Now give me George in the points
Vettel having an avoidable spin. F1 is officially back lads
SHOW THE MERCEDES
I’ve decided to only pay attention to P13+ this year... currently Kimi leading from Vettel. Good old times!
"BUT BONOOOOO HE'S USING THE KERBS MORE!

....it's not fair..."
"Sensor gods, please freak out and let someone else win today. Mercedes will have their 1-2 next week anyway"
I hope it's obvious that there are no sensor issues
Kerbs go brrrrr
James tells both Bottas and Hamilton to stay the fuck away from the kerbs - including the red and white ones
"SOCIAL DISTANCING YOU GUYS

I blame the helicopter shot"
"Mereceds 1 and 2 at the front, Seb spinning, both Hass retiring first race of the year, looks like everything is finally back to normal!!"
LETS GO ALBONO
What sort of agreement does Horner have with sky? Hes the only one they interview midrace
Maybe it was called earlier. But i thought I saw Albon ahead of Perez before the SC
That had to be scary for Kimi to watch... seeing one of your tires fall off
"This some bullshit, Alex had that move down"
NORRIS PODIUM COME ON BABY I CAN FEEL IT
"> You need some patience Alex

Was Alex even at fault?

Looked like Lewis's mistake tbh.

Brundle knows more though I mean"
He didn’t fucking give him room. Classic fucking Hamilton.
Lmao fucking hell sky get off Lewis’ cock
I personally think racing incident tbh.
"not only does mercedes dominate the entire race, as soon as someone gets close they are taken out

great racing"
Get fucked Lewis
New from NASCAR that was a damn good race
There’s a bunch of RB fans calling Ferrari a shitbox that look really stupid right now.
"What a mental race, how has Leclerc just dragged that car to P2"
I know the big talking point will be Lando but what a performance by Leclerc.... Some fantastic driving
LANDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
***WHERRRRRE IS LANDOOOOOO?***
This results gotta be rough on seb
"Unbelievable race absolute chaos but perfect 

Merc dominating but albon and lewis pulling Brazil move
. great result for Lando but unbelievable result for ferrari even though their terrible car....bravo Charles bravo for pushing hard

Edit: well done Valtteri...

can't wait for next week"
This makeshift podium on the track surface is a good substitute for the circumstances. Sorta has the feel of conquering the turf (which is also why I like the track shaped trophies like this one and Monaco's).
Did ESPN lady say tune into the Syrian GP next week?
Lando pls.
">It's finally lights out in 2020, and away we go.  Great start from  Norris on the clean side, taking Verstappen.  Bottas leads into T1, with Norris to his outside.   Norris gets a great run out of T1 slipstreaming up the hill into T2.  

>Norris on the inside of T2!  

>Norris leads! 

>Verstappen and Hamilton have had a coming together behind them Martin.

>Two seconds Ted.  We have a Safety Car."
F1TV DOWN FFS
F1TV taking shit again use sportsurge.net/#/streamlist/1144
"Race discussion is what is happening in some chats... Not the kind of race you would expect, unfortunately."
[deleted]
"Try F1TV on mobile, working for me there"
Excited to see what Lando can do. A bit of drama at T1 is needed and he might lead a lap!
ITS HAPPENING
F1TV is down... this is so infuriating 🤬
"Lando, you got this bro"
"F1TV is only working on my phone app, try there if you can't get anything else to work. Only works because I had logged in for practice and qualy."
#DUN DUN DUN!!!!
"In the last 7 months I could have learned to code and made a better app than this. I mean all they have to do is stream the sky feed, its ridiculous."
"So in the backdrop to Max's intro on the F1 intro is his dad's Benetton going up in flames, interesting easter egg."
Am i the only one who's getting little bit annoyed by that Alfa Romeo advertisement?
it bugs me irrationally that the music after the intro is in a different key now
GOOSEBUMPS!! It’s time!!
Not loving the new random upwards semitone keychange between the intro music and the track map music.
Thanks ESPN for not giving a shite and cutting back in way after the theme
"Pirate all the way, F1TV just keeps loading."
ESPN missed the intro for Herpes commercials
My body. It is ready.
I’ve never been more excited for a race ever in the decade I’ve been watching this sport
Missed the line up music! They should revert it to how it was last season..
Imagine paying for a streaming service and still having to bootleg it :)
"Dont lie Crofty, we all know if Daniel Ricciardo wins today all Coronavirus cases will be cured and a vaccine found immediately."
FINALLY
God I love this circuit. One of the most beautiful on the calendar.
"Good to see F1TV shitting the bed on the first race of the year. Never change, you incompetent fucks."
"I miss hearing Brundle, LETS GO!"
The day has finally arrived
Fuck f1tv
"Drinking game: Take a drink every time someone mentions how disappointing Ferrari's performance is

And yes I know that will kill me, that's the point"
Bottas goes bye
Bottas straight up chilling with Max on mediums slowing everyone down
Oh my god Bottas is gone
Bottas is going to be well out of DRS range by lap 3.
Why are the RP's smoking this much?
It's really fun to see more teams at the front (Ignoring Bottas' massive lead already).
Great start for Lando & Alex
That mercedes is a fucking rocket jesus christ
Remember that verstappen is on mediums
How many times is F1TV going to break my fucking heart
#RACING POINT IS FASTER THAN FERRARI. Pass it on
"2.5sec gap after 2 laps.

holy shit"
How the hell can that smoke on the RP’s be normal. Been like that all weekend.
Bottas 3.0 is gonna beat Hamilton to the WDC then retire.
Where is the Merc going holy shit
William 19th and 20th....
The pace of that Mercedes is terrifying
Damnit what is this race pace
Sergio Perez is looking good
5 laps and Ferrari have gained one position. Yikes
[deleted]
haha kerbs go brrrrr
Did anybody actually expect Mclaren to be faster than the mercs and red bulls? Let's be realistic here.
That Mclaren doesn't have straight line pace?
No real race pace in that McLaren it seems.
"Mercedes - Red Bull - Red Bull - Mercedes - McLaren - Racing Point - Ferrari - McLaren - Racing Point - Ferrari

I kind the like the pattern. :D"
Show us the fucking midfield.
Come on Alex!!!!
"I'm gonna take a hit every time I see Perez' car smoking. Goodnight, everyone"
First time watching Formula 1. Really enjoying it from the practices and the qualifications and i'm having quite some fun. I've got a question... Is it from my stream or is the commentators sound too low compared to the cars? I nearly can't hear them. Is it normal?
F1TV working on the app but still no website...
That Ferrari onboard sounded like the audio was from a mobile phone
God I've missed this
The gap between the top 4 and the rest is crazy
Unpopular opinion: Race start replays are superfluous when pretty much everyone had a good start and not a single small incident took place.
Is anyone else unable to even see the race on F1 tv?
Lewis is having the same puffs of smoke that Checo  has had all weekend
F1tv still not fucking working where is everyone watching the race
Yess Albon ..keep holding Ham...you are doin great
Brundle being really negative today... wtf.
Does the stream of f1tv not work for anyone else?
This is the perfect red bull test. How good is Albon at blocking Lewis
Watch that gap to max close real quick now
Ham looked quick as fuck during that pass. Now he's got a lot of clean air to play with.
Albon had visions of Brazil and just let him go.
Jesus that Merc is just off like a rocket in clean air. Absolutely absurd.
When was the last time Ferrari were not on screen in the first ten minutes of a race?
3 DRS Zones are wayy to much for F1
Verstappen out. Mercedes title is done
"I had almost forgotten how much I hate DRS as a concept.

I'd much rather have less overtaking than what we just saw for P3."
Now that's the Honda I know
RIP MY FANTASY TEAM
"God, this killed my hype for the race severely"
Jesus christ
F for Verstappen...and Red Bull’s chances.
"ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME

THATS THE CHAMPIONSHIP HOPES GONE

ONE RACE DNFed AND ITS GONE"
Mercedes 1 2 here we come woooooo :(
Gg poor max
Omg I feel so bad for Max
"Lando, here is your chance!!!"
Literally the first race the Honda engine ran as title contender
"""We need Ferrari strong, we need Ferrari out front..."" 

But do we?"
Well it was a nice race for a whole 10 laps. Good win Mercedes
Congrats to Mercedes on the 1-2
bump starting an f1 car lmao
Red Bull apparently builds cars the way I cook
U cant escape the lercedes 1-2
Fucking hell merc 1-2
Absolutely awful for Max
Crofty takes the piss out of everything 😂😂
Albon 1st podium?
FFS. Merc is going to 1/2 every race this year.
Two seconds Ted 2020
" HONDA BEAT:

# A   C   T   I   V   A   T   E"
Lando podium somehow pls
"really nice of Mercedes to stay in the front and make sure no pigeons are on track
/s
F for max"
"They’re going to call Alex in and give Verstappen his car, a la front wing situation"
Max is going to need a punching bag
Prays for Albon podium
Red Bull will have packed up and gone home by the time Alex needs to pit.
Albon podium or midfield podium at least
This is peak Drive to Survive content.
Ok Alex pls just bring it home
Lol Hamilton dropping to 5th did absolutely nothing
Well this race is over
Williams not last Pog
The wind has been taken out of Crofty's voice. He seems as disappointed as we are
Can we crowdfund some NOS for Albon's car now
Lando or Albon podium will be nice
We should make Fornula 0 where only Mercedes races so the other 18 cars can actually race each other
These new regulations can’t come soon enough. This merc domination is getting boring. Things need to get shaken up a bit
Seb probably can't believe the fact he's battling a fucking Racing Point and Renault for position
There is no way Bottas can throw away a 7 second lead
"Lmao ""There's an engine problem"". I wonder if it's got anything to do with the fucking cloud it's making above the track."
Did Racing Point copy Mercedes cooling issues too?
"I like Albon, but I need a Lando😂😂😂😂😂😂 podium"
"We need that Simpson's meme where Homer is running around screaming ""It's still good! It's still good!"" but it's just gets progressively worse"
"well, watching this can't say we been missing much during lockdown"
Holy fuck they're actually showing the midfield
Mercedes broken engine still better than Ferrari engine.
Norris quietly just pulled out a 2 second gap to Perez
Lap 17 and they just said we could have a good fight for 3rd. How thrilling.
"A Vettel march to podium, or Albon/Norris on podium is the only thing that redeems this race."
Someone get Jeff Bezos into F1 so he can shovel several billion dollars into a team to beat Mercedes
Ferrari can't even pass a faulty Mercedes PU. Ouch!
Engines are shit today.
"Kimi 16th, ferrari 5th car and Mercedes will win every race. Why am I even watching at this point"
nooooooooo danny ric too???
when Ferrari cant catch a RP with a broken engine lmao
Renault out as always (?)
"Nooo, Daniel :("
Poor Daniel :(
Fuck me!! Both of my guys out of the race before lap 20
Heat issue? What happens when we get to Spain in August?
Renault Master plan....
NOOOO Not Danny
"I’m just glad F1 is back. It’s redundant to see a Merc 1-2 yes, but it’s better than nothing"
Man Danny has the worst luck
Verstappen and Ricciardo like he never left Red Bull in 2018.
So glad Danny Ric is going to have a car he deserves next year. Renault has really let him down
"So Racing Point has engine issues with the Mercedes

Max's Honda messed up

Dani's Renault just pooped its pants

Ferrari is Ferrari

Is there a single engine not shitting the bed?"
No Daniel :(
All these issues are saving Ferrari here
2 favorite drivers gone on lap 19
Daniel “Mark Webber” Ricciardo
"Engines: ""This is boring, we out"""
Stroll already 2.2 behind Seb. Must have serious issues
Goodnight fellow Aussies!
Watch as Vettel is the next one with issues
Thats why Dan is leaving
Ferrari sweep both championships because they have the most reliable engine
"vettel already overtook verstappen and stroll and got easily away from ricciardo, this race is looking great so far /s"
They're dropping like flies!
Lando has really good race pace matching Albon’s lap times and quicker than his teammate
Wouldn't it be awesome if Bottas won this championship and then pulled a Nico and retired?
Lance has major issues now
I wonder how much shit Max has destroyed in his room so far.
#MAGNUSSEN ALMOST IN THE POINTS
Ferrari the only engine supplier not to have engine problems in this race yet
"So many questions! 

Will Hamilton pass Bottas? Probably! Will anything exciting happen? Don't hold your breath!"
"This ""Ferrari"" team is looking pretty promising, if they keep their heads down they might be able to become the best team in the midfield."
Stroll dropping like a rock. Will retire soon I guess
As far as I know this sport Bottas will get engine problems very soon
"If Mercedes were going to use DAS for tyre preservation, they would have used it by now. A hot track where they need softs to last, and they haven't tried it out. I now have even more questions."
"This is exactly what I have waited for so long.   
  
Merc. 1-2 with everyone else just dying."
"Who had ctrl alt del on their bingo card? 


What the fuck."
"Not to be outdone, Grosjean makes his own problems"
McLaren legit the 3rd best car on the grid?
everybody just wants back to their sims it seems
[deleted]
If we continue in this vein Ferrari might end up on the podium by process of elimination
GRO is so excited about the season that he is doing donuts.
"Grosjean driver error and Mercedes 1-2 

We back bois"
Can't wait to see Williams on the podium
Has anyone seen Sainz yet
"oh dear, Grosjean, you don't get bonus points for doing tricks"
Darth Hamilton setting fastest lap after fastest lap
Can’t show any midfield racing if the entire midfield dnf’s. F1 broadcasting playing 5d chess
How many cars we expecting to cross the line?
Is anybody still awake? If you're struggling to stay awake then I would suggest you make some coffee and sip on it very slowly.
"Hamilton is flying, no doubt Bottas is saving a little bit though."
Russell 15th!!!
God Lewis is on it. Valtteri has no pace it seems
"My commentators saying they're not sure who Ferrari is trying to fool and who is their target group lol

What a shitshow I absolutely love it"
"The great Ferrari masterplan is working, they actually created the most reliable engine ever."
It’s sad that Mercedes is so far ahead. We don’t even have fronte row close racing  anymore
Russell’s no where. Shame.
"Looking at Bottas' lap times, Verstappen could have had a big chances to win. Fucking hell"
Guys do the drivers control the DRS or is it automatic or something else?
Bottas desperately trying to practice social distancing to Hamilton. Hamilton having none of it.
"Damn, the Renault engine sounds like a jet fighter engine with the turbo"
Magnussen 😂😂
Renault engine sounds crazy.
Haas and brake issues name a better combo
At least we're getting more midfield footage
Lol what was that
That Renault sounds super weird.
That Renault sounds like an absolute bag of nails
SAFETY CAR
hass having a nightmare somethings truly never change
"Sky sports...when u actually show the midfield, could you maybe talk about that instead of mercedes"
"Bottas won Australia first race last year.

He's on pace to win Austria the first race this year.

It's the exact same thing, minus a few letters. Realities writers are getting lazy."
We look like focking vankers!
"Classic Haas shenanigans? Ricciardos car failing?

We’re truly back."
"This has been a crazy start. 3 engine failures???? in the first 25 laps???? 

Give me more chaos lmao"
Valtteri will be shitting his pants now. Jeez
"Just as I was thinking ""MAG's actually looking respectable here, almost into the points...""


BAH."
That Haas car wants to kill itself this weekend
Unsafe release there
That double stop from Mercedes was beautiful.
Unsafe release
"Holy shit, that was an unsafe release from Racing Point, damn."
"Checo and Lando, wheel to wheel action!! :o"
Perez WTF
Mercedes can’t do anything wrong can they?
One of each engine manufacturer out for reliability.
Perez getting a penalty
"Heart almost stopped, god damn"
jesus that pit release
Mercedes is just insanely professional.
That was pretty dodgy from Racing Point
Poor Latifi. Why did Williams not try to double stack? Maybe they felt he might be to close to his team mate?
Surprised Alpha Tauri weren't tasked with the triple stack
[deleted]
"Jesus, for my second live race this is exciting so far"
Can we please get names on the halo for all cars!
Does Haas always have awful luck during the first race of the season?
"Mercs take each other out, pleassssseeeee"
"Unsafe release IMO, and this season is gonna be the Mercedes show"
Press F for Bottas.
I think all the teams have forgotten to put points into reliability
Fresh hard tires behind a safety car? Going to be a loosey goosey restart
Fresh hard tires behind a safety car? Going to be a loosey goosey restart
Well at least if Albons on the podium it's redemption from what happened in Brazil last year.
If the Mercedes guys collided it would give us one of the best possible podiums
"The more I look at it, the more impressed I am by K-Mag spinning, stopping, and avoiding the wall."
The Mercedes look evil in black. I'd do a poo if I saw one flying up behind me
Magnussens issue was scary
"That puff of black smoke from KMags right front, bye bye brake."
I wonder if Valtteri and Lewis are about to take each other out for the first time
Gio and Kimi are a solid lineup but the car is utter shit
Come on Russell.
Four different engines retired. Lol
2 years for DAS? RB don't have a chance.
I get the feeling Merc developed DAS just to get Lewis to stop complaining about the safety car speed
This will be a proper test for Bottas. We are about to find out whether he can take the fight to Hamilton!
My simple thinking roughly 30 laps on softs you should be able to do 40 on mediums
SBIN
"Vettel didn’t change I see, that was way too fucking late to sting"
Vettel spins again.....
S🅱️inella
That’s on Seb.
"Well done F1. This race has it all.

Edit: Spelling"
OH GOTT MUSS DAS SEIN VETTEL
Another day at the office
That's too good to be true.
Omfg LOL
He did the thing!
"Sure Seb, that was gonna fit"
"Vettel said “you want this car, you can get sum of this car”"
You couldn't script a better incident
"Vettel spinning, we are really back"
Its not enough to take the mans seat huh?
It wouldn’t be a quality race without Vettel spinning.
Vettel to Haas confirmed
Some things never change
Essere clowns
Seb going full send. He has nothing to lose
Finally F1 is officially back. Vettel spins
There was NO gap there dude. Holy shit vettel lmao
WTF WAS THAT LOL
Incredible
VETTELOL
Russell p12 woooo
WE GOT THE SPIN. WE GOT THE SPIN
"Imagine fighting with your future ""top team"" car"
"Seb spinning, now F1 is really back."
This race: Pain
Just in case you were wondering why there was no new contract offer
I was excited to see Sainz pass Leclerc and then have a battle of Charles vs Vettel but no
Vettel drove that car straight in there deep. Whats new
Why is Latifi so far back?
WTF SEB!
Netflix series writing itself with that from Seb
Sebastian why do you do this to me
See ya
Just started watching f1 after all the twitch races. Has someone ever had a huge lead and ended up losing because people caught up because of a few safety car lap/s?
Vettel is getting the lasts of his donuts lol.
"George Russel. Nobody talks about George Russel. 

Lmao"
Bottas kalm
F1.5 has me excited to be honest
Merc merc pink merc sooner than later. Holy shit this is exciting.
Why does LEC car sounds like it's in a can
Or is Sen being the ultimate team player?! Getting rid of Saiz for Leclerc. /s
Vettel bringing some normalcy to this post covid-19 world
Does Perez keep his mediums until the end???
Russell P12!
Mercedes: lets turn down the engines
Imagine flexing so goddamn hard that you're able to turn down your engine mode and still dominate. WTF
Multi 77-44?
Black and white flag for Grosjean - track limits warning
Grosjean lol
This is exactly how I was telling myself this race was gonna go to try to ease the pain of when it inevitably happened
"At least we're having a McLaren Ferrari battle again, so nostalgic."
"Grosjean, a driver on the limit. Pushing everything out of his car and even going past track limits... on P14

Edit: 15*"
Actual chance of Checo on podium. My god
You can't tell them to not fight half way through the race when no one is going to challenge lol
Valtteri is obviously struggling why call a good scrap off in the first race
the fact that Mercedes are already talking about turning down the engine before halfway through the race is sad and shows just how far they are ahead of everyone.
"""Maybe you could do a donut to give the other guys a change"""
Why do the ferrari engines soung god awful
"So mercedes is having PU reliability issues. So possible - Albon , Noris and Leclerc podium. Ahhh my dreams"
These commentators doing their best to justify this meme sport. Total cope happening. How they managed to say this shit with straight faces is beyond me.
"Mercedes, 1-2-3 inc"
Press F to pay your condolences to Bottas
Fastest lap on hards.....welp.
OK I do like the use of the rear view camera on the halo graphic.
This mirror cam is great tbh
.... please run into each other... please run into each other...
"Ooh, that rear view graphic is nifty"
Assetto Corsa esque rear view mirror lol
Leclerc cannot close down McLaren. 5 Ferrari engines in bottom 6. What a great team!
That one time there is actual fighting happening at the front we get to see the ferrari just cruising around...
"Ahh Ferrari fighting McLaren, throwback time."
Lmao why does the Ferrari sound like an RC car
"Oh my, they've got a rear view mirror HUD element on the inside of the halo."
"""Race the wheels off""

Is there a drinking game I don't know about or is Martin just trying to win a bet?"
Imagine if the drivers actually had that halo HUD.
"Holy hell, the mic quality in the Ferrari is atrocious"
[deleted]
Would love to see Russell get some points here.
GEORGE RUSSELL HYPE TRAIN
loving the rear view camera graphic on the inner halo
Renault engine does not sound good 😬
A McLaren ahead of a Ferrari on pace. What year is this
"The Renault sounds like ear rape. 

A vacuum on steroids."
Albon is the new Sainz this year. Haven't shown him on track since Hamilton passed him
Why do I smell a Checo podium?
I think/hope Ferrari is testing out the budget cap this season
On boards sound terrible
Really hope George can squeeze into the points
Leclerc in a mclaren sandwich uwu
What is Latifi doing?
Can someone help the Renault engine? It just sounds constantly in pain
Seeing Charles struggle to reach 300 km/h down the straight after turn 1 is painful
The Mercs being 6 seconds clear of everyone else epitomises their absolute dominance
Call team orders first race. We riot.
At least we know our Sunday next week is free :)
The Renault engine sounds horrible.
I haven’t seen a shot of the the hilltop Austrians yet.
Jesus Christ what is is being blended inside that Renault engine
So good there are no cuts to show the crowd today
MAXIMUM PACE
"This is your opportunity, Bottas. Shut the door every single time."
MAXIMUM PACE
Can Russell manage to sneak into the points?
Hobby racer Kimi currently beating future 5x WDC winner Vettel.
Mercedes version of Multi-21?
"Having Albon and Perez 3,4 has gotta make you smile though"
That sounds like a Mercedes multi 21...
Curbs are lethal
TV director having a stroke
pls stay off the curbs c:
I want Alex and Lando to both get a podium
Is it bad if I want 2 of them to crash?
"After all the Seb appreciation these past months, the memes are gonna return, why Seb why?!"
The merc really works in dirty air jeez
For a moment I thought Crofty talking about airflow was referring to Toto’s face shield lmao
"It doesn't even look like Mercedes is racing hard, and they're still pulling away."
"Ooooh, Mercedes cant go on kerbs.."
"Hamilton biding his time, saving ERS, tyres, fuel. F1 2019 was realistic after all."
this is 2014 on crack jeeesus
Straight up I can imagine Liberty behind the scenes telling the FiA that Ferrari can have their 2019 power unit back.
"Mercs to tussle, Toto pounding a table and Albon a career first win?"
"Let’s see what Lewis does on the straight!
TV broadcasters: Cuts to Toto"
Life where vettel can’t pass the cars in the back....
Fuck these tsn ads hit at all the wrong times..
Unleash that thing Lando!
Pure mental battle between Ham and Bot. Only I think Bot might just make it out on top.
"When a helicopter shot from 300 feet in the sky shows only the Mercs and no one else, you have some serious parity issues."
Have to laugh at both of them continuing to abuse the kerbs.
"""Sensor issues"""
This is an Ad for Mercedes - How many laps now are we going to watch two cars parade.
"Lol, Merc double retirement incoming like it's 2016."
What are kerbs? Lol mercs
Lewis tattling to dad that Valtteri isn’t listening.
"If the two mercs dont make it, Albon might win this race and Lando will get a podium.

- Captain Obvious"
"Gasly/Kvyat controlling 8th and 9th tightly, just can't quite get into a position to catch Sainz."
"I think the Merc engineers are bluffing..

So the cars don't crash into each other."
Hamilton is the same level of petty as me. I’m starting to like him.
"They are 9 seconds ahead (after a safety car) and they aren't pushing anymore.

Geez"
"""Valtteri, it's sensor."""
Copy James
STAY ON THE CURBS
"""Stop Racing each other""

- Mercedes

""It's a fucking race!""

- Hamilton."
Lmfao merc
IT’S JAMES
We have one Ferrari behind a Williams and one far away from a Racing Point. Welcome to 2020.
Critical issues. James? Is that you?
"You guys have a different video feed for sure, Ive been looking at 10 minutes of straight ham vs bot."
And now for the Lewis and Valterri show...
VALTTERI ITS JAMES
Sensors are the new dead tyres?
How long until James in tears ‘please stay off the curbs’
Merc doesn't do Horner foot :(
"Lmao 

> “He’s using more curb than me.”"
"These cars seem unsafe, retire them Mercedes."
Mercs about to explode
Mercs are faking problems again. They don't want their drivers battling. Still they drive half a second faster then anyone else on the track.
"Ocon is in the back of Kvyat, let's see that pls."
formula mercedes
Curbs to save the race? Mercedes DNF incoming ?
Mercs please stay on the curbs
Mercs racing in 2020. Everyone else racing in 2010s.
Just two cars this GP?
It’s amazing that Seb is stuck in 14th and has been for so long.
"The Mercs are going to retire at this rate, they're both all over the kerbs"
Williams battling with Ferrari again !!
VET still behind RUS. Grazzie Carbonara
Vettel still behind a williams lmao
Vettel stuck behind Russell
Can't wait for the cycling season to begin
"Holy shit, there’s other cars on the track?! Who knew?!"
Grosjean Grosjean off the track
Lmao Grosjean is so shite
Grosjean???? off the track?? color me surprised!
"Surely a ""critical"" sensor will fail within 20 more laps right?  C'mon race gods make this interesting"
Why is Grosjean?
Latifi should thank Grosjean once the race is over.
Grosjean just out on a leisurely drive
RUSSEL NO
George 😭😭😭😭😭
"roses are red   
violets are blue   
another season   
of mercedes 1-2"
"Haas practicing social distancing on track, good of them"
"Oh George, no..."
Oh George :((
"oh boy, what did we get ourselves into"
Another safety car... Perez's dream is coming true
I'm glad to see we're getting another great Haas episode of Drive to Survive.
Haas doing Haas things...
Come on Seb redeem yourself
Noooooo George
It's confirmed - Latifi will be 10th
bunch of cross country vankers
William's = the green shells in mario cart
Odds on Merc lying to get them to behave?
"all my favorite drivers out lol, except Sainz"
F in chat for Russel?
Lol bottas just can't catch a break.
RIP George. But let see if Albon and Checo can figure the Merc with their issues
"2 merc engines, 1 Renault, 1 Honda, 0 Ferrari"
This could get interesting
This should be interesting now that Mercs can't take the kerbs
All the cars are saying nah to race distance
"Absolute snoozefest lol, only mechanical dnfs"
Damn George was running well too
It’s funny how selective people are in remembering the Honda engine performances.
guys it's happening (please)
What the fuck is happening lmao
Mercedes might be in actual trouble.
"golly, half the field will be out at this rate."
feels like 2015 australia all over again with so many mechanical Dnfs
Pink mercedes to beat the real mercedes
Can't remember the last time there was this many technical retirements
At least that pesky Williams is out of the ferraris way now LOL
Why is Sainz pitting now lol
Albon ftw
Latifi to do a Kubica and score points
Albon on softs! He could seriously gain some pace on the mercs now!
"George, oh dear oh my."
Come on Alex
"I’m Alex Albon. I’m here to fuck shit up. 

Soft tires, let’s go!"
A late charge from a Red Bull in Austria? I think I've seen this one before
Come on Albon!
LET’S GOOOOOOOOL AAAAAAALLLLLLEEXXXXXXXXXXX!!!!
Perez will try to hold up Albon
Albon going to be on softs attacking Perez. Hopefully the director decides to show us some of it.
Is there any reason why RP wouldnt pit Checo right now? Seems like its a risky start to go to the end with mediums.
Hot take: Alex P1
HILL AUSTRIANS YES
"Dude I love Crofty trying to hype this up but BOT and HAM will just drive away after this SC. Not even a chance that this is ""dangerous"" for them, especially with Max retired."
Found the locals
This is one of those one in 100 races where everthing goes wrong for the big teams
They always find the fans
damn let my man ted talk
Why tf didnt we double stack
"Someone said yesterday that outlook would be packed today!

Although why has sometime driven a digger up there?"
Why the fuck did they pit Sainz so late?
Go albon
"""Ted I'm just going to interrupt you....""

Every season never ending and it's not a F1 race if that line isn't said half a dozen times"
Can someone explain why Sainz didn't pit in the first Safety car lap? He lost two positions there
Oh shit. People in the mountains not social distancing. They look like Tusken Raiders from the pod race.
"I’ve needed a wee for the last 20 minutes, was gonna go then the safety car came out.... if albon overtakes a Mercedes it’s all over for me"
No one actually has any reliability lmao
God speed Alex. We’re all with you
Latifi will probably never finish this high again this year
"2 Mercedes retiring in Austria? Could never happen!

\*laughs in 2018\*"
Safety car on the curbs - gearbox issues coming!
Ah for fuck sake
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS RACE?
THIS RACE
Kimi got fucked?
"Ok, this race has not been bad"
What a shitshow
GIVE ALBON P3
Lmao what even is this race?
you picked a fine time to leave me loose wheel?
I wouldn't be surprised if Latifi gets into points by the end of the race.
You got to imagine they're telling Latifi to just drive as slow as possible. Probably the most viable strategy
Whew someone is sweating heavily right now
Was Albon ahead when sc came out?
Haven't seen a wheel fly away for a while. Damn bad pit.
what in the world
WHAT IS GOING ON
"What a way to start 2020, nobody is going to finish this race"
"Jeez that was lucky that nobody copped the tyre, it was fanging it across the track for a second there."
Ah man poor Albon.
what a gongshow
this race is just a summary of 2020
Poor pit crew installation?
"Damn, that tire went back to his home planet."
kimi :(
Wtf the tyre
This is a brilliant opener
Albon can’t catch a break
Perez should give place back imo
Tyre: 'ight imma head out.
Kimi saved Perez? Why Albon is still 4th?
Gotta swap Perez and Albon
WTF that's bizarre
Scriptwriter: Michael Bay.
"shit, Kimi's wheel head out too LMAO"
Poor Kimi
"Without any rule changes this season is already over. Handing Mercedes Championships left and right. The quickest cars, the most reliable cars. Untouchable. Sigh..."
Latifi getting closer to the points
Extremely dangerous. Vettel was lucky.
The front fell off
What the fuck??
Kimi heads back to his boat for a beer
Alex so unlucky ugh
So will everyone in front of Vettel retire until he has a point?
*sad bwoah noises*
"Only 3 running cars out of the points, and one is a Ferrari."
Tyre: aight imma head out
At this pace Latifi will get points
The front fell off.
Vettel is going to end up top 10 by the end hahaha
Latifi might actually get a point before Russel... 🤔😯
"kimi's tire just ""aight, imma head out"""
Going to be an exciting final ~~20~~ 10 laps!
That’s dangerous as shit having a Tyre flying around like that.
That tyre was the embodiment of r/mypeopleneedme
Such a 2020 race
Absolute carnage with so many cars out
This race went from boring to really interesting
Imagine if latifi scores a point before russell
all the cars are failing what's going on lmaoo
Latifi points hype?
What a shitshow
Feel bad for Albon. He's amost lost his maiden podium.
Can't be an opening race of the season without a wheel falling off after a pitstop.
The tire returned to his people.
Fastest pit stops ever
"Are you allowed to overtake under yellows?

There were yellows on when Albon overtaked Perez?

I mean asking because Crofty was saying that the overtake was cool and didn't break rules and I think Brundle somewhat agreed with him?"
I'll be a bit disappointed if Latifi scores points before George does.
Vettel was so lucky not hitting the tyre
At this rate of vehicle failure I think I’ll have to root for the safety car this GP.
Kimi just got confused when he was told to drive the wheels off his car
This is going down in history books
Uk it’s bad when retirement highlights are shown instead of overtaking highlights
Did the wheel come off before he got the kerb?
Safety cars are all part of the Mercedes master plan to ensure nobody can pass for the rest of the race while they have gearbox issues
“No Kimi you will not have the wheel”
Latifi P13 is probably way better than he expected
Should Perez have to give the place back to albon? Seems like albon got past before the safety car and then Perez took it back on the sc.
DER HAT EIN REIFEN VORLOREN
Everyone's going to have to get everything repaired for next weeks go around the same track. Good luck mechanics!
Up in the mountains to watch. That’s beautiful
"At this rate there’s gon be only 1 car left to complete the race, they probs took “we race as one” too literally"
retirement highlights to remind us it is still 2020 :(
Got to feel sorry for Max
looks like perez was dropped back
"Sainz radio - He thinks he was ahead when the light came on, team are checking with the FIA.

[edit] Corrected the driver... Sorry"
They gave Albon his place. Good job stewards.
netflix producers must be absolutely rock solid
The crazy thing is that Kimi was still flooring it despite seeing his wheel coming off.... what a mad man lol
Albon back to P3!
Perez gave the position
The scenes if Latifi scores points before George
I hope to god albon goes attack mode...mercedes are vulnerable
"Good. Was positive Albon had the move made before the flags, etc. were thrown."
ALBON FUCKING SEND IT NOW
Yes Albon!  Take that third place back
Liking this new Albon
"The tether stops the hub/upright flying away, NOT the wheel"
"""How long will they (Mercedes) be able to keep the rest at bay?"" - About two seasons, Crofty."
Who is getting knocked out next?
"I don't think Albon DECIDED to go 3rd all by himself Martin, obv the FIA would've checked that out"
Come on Alex. Avange for Brazil last year. Go get those Mercs!
ALBON FOR THE WIN PLEASE
"Honestly, red bull sometimes feel like they're in a class of their own. If only they had a better engine"
I could go for the Mercs dying and then an Albon-Perez-Norris race for the win
Cant wait for Mercedes to pull out a 10 second gap to everyone even though they're on the hard tires
Nooo allexxxxxx
Albon is a meme
NOOOOOOOO WHY FUCK FUCK FUCK FUUUUUCK NOOOOOOOOOO ALBOOOONNNNNN NOOOOO
"Alright let's do this, 3 more retirements"
Oh dear Albon not again
FUCK
HE'S DONE IT AGAIN! WHY ARE WE IN 2019
Fucking Hamilton a-fucking-gain.
FOR FUCK SAKE
Shit Albon against Lewis again
I’m dead inside. C’mon Alex
Ahhhh fuck I can’t believe you’ve done this Hamilton
Again?
Noooooo!!! Gooodd!! Nooo!!
At least Red Bull gets another home race...
Vettel finally in points
who's fault is that?
NOOOOOOOOOOO
Alex! I give him credit for wanting to go for it but he needs to be careful!
Gutted for Albon - but I almost saw it coming - too good to be true :/
Drop Hamilton a few places stewards
All the time you have to leave the space
How did I know that was going to happen
Albon got hosed
"WHAT THE FUCK, DOES HAMILTON'S CAR HAVE A FUCKING FORCE FIELD?"
Fuck sake man
penalty incoming?
Albon is not blessed like Hamilton
PTSD for albon
How much room did Alex have?
lmao fucking unbeliavable
Hamilton pls DNF
Perez for the win
F for Albono. Again.
"please, something has to happen, we can't have another Merc 1-2"
Lmao hamilton fucking hates albon
THAT'S NORRIS
"Fuck man, 2nd place was Albon's to take. He looked to be faster with the softs on. Hamilton's fault or not, Albon should have been a little more patient."
Leclerc for podium?
The F1 Gods have smiled on us today for our patience
Sharl lechair why
LECLERC MY BOY
Sky really seem to be struggling to differentiate Sainz and Norris.
Imagine if after all this we get a Ferrari on the podium lmao
Leclerc podium in a dumpster Ferrari? Here we go
God if Leclerc gets a podium in this shit box
Leclarc does well there . Good Racing
Fuck me sideways. Who knew Charles fucking Leclerc will be on the podium lol. With that shitbox of a Ferrari.
Leclerc is muscling that Ferrari around like a mad man. Great racer.
How many times is he gonna mix up Norris and Sainz
Lmao ferrari might as well do Quali next week on hards
Just realized Gio overtook Vettel. WTF
Back off LEC I want PER on podium
WHAT A MOVE
COME ON LECLERC
Yessss LEC my man
"CHARGE, LECLERC!"
This race is fucked
Christ almighty Sharls that was gutsy.
McLaren pls
LECLERC P2 BOYS
LOL this race
Bottas fuck up and Ferrari P1
"You know, with this short season of unknown total races, I bet that fastest lap point has a bigger chance of being a really important thing."
Leclerc is dragging that car kicking and screaming through this race
HAMMER TIME
Norris on the podium??
NORRIS ON PODIUM
LANDO PODIUM
Dude holy shit WHAT IS HAPPENING
Albon should have forced another SC just to fk with Hamilton
Norris podium??!!!
"Norris, holy shit, basically punched Perez out of the way"
HAMMER DOWN LANDO HELL FOR LEATHER SON
"hamiltons mistake was trying to leave room, he should have just squeezed him off like albon did to him at the start"
CALM DOWN LANDO HE'S ALREADY DEAD
YEEEEEEES LANDOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOO
"I just tuned in, what is this Mad Max race? How are so many cars out?"
Wtf is this race
Feels like an endurance race lmao so many dnfs
THE DOOR WAS WIDE OPEN??
Lmfao another one i can't
Hahahah incredible
What is going on 😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lol this race is fucked.
didn't think Gasly would be the last RB driver on track
LANDO
"I was joking about Latifi points earlier, but now I’m just actually sitting here shocked"
That tire just absolutely exploded
F1 gods I was joking about Latifi getting p10 pls stop
"Looking at it again, he deserves the penalty. But you know if it was someone else, it would just be good aggressive driving"
"Fucking hell, on course to get a point for just finishing here."
Everyone who crosses that finish line is a winner for just getting there today.
This is an Endurance Race more than a F1 Race lmao.
Latifi deserves points for just finishing.
Let’s go Norris! You’ve been given so many miracles today!
"You get a penalty!, you get a penalty!, EVERYBODY GETS A PENALTY!"
Latifi to beat Russell 1-0 this year?
Ahahahah Latifi to get his first F1 points before Russell
Its awesome to see McLaren back in the top
#Monaco 96 energy
"Oh man, this race got insane at the end"
WHAT AN INCREDIBLE RACE
WHAT A LAP FROM LANDO
NORRIS PODIUM
BEST RACE EVER THANK YOU OMG LANDO AND CHARLES ON PODIUM AAAAAAA
yes Norris!!!!!
NORRIS PODIUM HYPE
WHAT IS THIS RACE
Let’s Goooooo!
FUCK YEAH LANDO!!!!
LANDO PARTY!!!!
Holy fuck these last 10 laps have really delivered.
FUCK YEA LANDO YOU BEASST!
LANDOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
NORRIS PODIUM HYPE
Landoooooooooo
LANDO FUCKING NORRIS
"Norris did it, i'm pretty sure"
LANDO PODIUM HYPE
LEC SECOND
Laaanddddooooo
Hahaha fucking hell. Get in there Lando.
FASTEST LAP TO GET IT WOWWWWWWWW
Merc fucked that up could’ve got the podium
FUCK YES NORRIS GET IYNNNNNNNNN
LANDO P3 P3 IN IN IN IN
WHAT A RACE OH MY GOD
Bottas slowed down Lewis lol
HOLY FUCK WHAT A RACE.
HOLYYY SHITT LANDOOOOO
Lewis really helping McLaren grab those points
Lol. Norris on podium and fastest lap. Insane but good for him. Shitty for Albon.
WHAT IS GOING ON?? I CAN'T EVEN.
2 PODIUMS IN 3 RACES LETS GO MCLAREN
LANDOOOOOO
LAAANDOOOO
FUCK YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAh
Lewis knocks albon of the podium and gets penalized and gives a McLaren their first podium.... lol
"LANDOOOOOO

LET'S GOOOOOOO! HAHAHAHAHA"
Can we just have Norris Albon Russell Sainz in F1?
WHAT A FINISH LANDO LETS GO
LET'S FUCKING GOOO LANDO CHARLES AND BOTTAS
LANDOOOOO MATE
"Bottas had to pick up the pace at the end, he held Lewis up lol. smart personal move but not great for the team."
NORRIS IN A MCLAREN GOT HIS FIRST PODIUM BEFORE ALBON IN A RED BULL!
"Albon died for McLaren's podiums. 

Fucking beautiful by Lando, though."
Can RB protest LH's 5 second penalty and ask for more?
Best season confirmed
FIRST TWITCH STREAMER ON THE PODIUM AAAAAAAA
Five laps ago I was screaming at Norris to let Sainz pass because Carlos seemed much faster...
WHAT A RACE
LANDO forgot about how to drive up for a podium finish. Been so long for him that hes knocking over the sign :D
"Great for Lando, gutted for Perez. He was doing everything right until he wasn’t lol."
WHAT A RACE. WE LOVE AUSTRIA!!!!!
Albon dotd but didnt even finish
Just want to give a shout out to my boy Carlos who had a great race but was kinda screwed by strategy and SC pitting.
I really hope Bottas can be this competitive all season.
What an excellent job by Bottas. That's what 99 awareness looks like
LANDOOOOOO!!!
What a race!
Lol @hitting the 3rd sign Lando.
"Poised from Bottas, so happy for Lando!"
Lando pushed off the 3rd marker board
Lando is my spirit animal
Lando ramming the shit out of the P3 sign lmao
Some sweet justice for Albon that Hamilton doesn't get a podium and his friend gets it instead ayyyyy
GET THAT BOY SOME MILK!!!
POG LANDO POGGGG
Inb4 Lando 5 second penalty for running into that 3 just then
LANDOOOOO!!!
I'm so fucking happy for Lando and McLaren!
Unexpected podium for Ferrari
"I hope Bottas has a fair chance this year, I’m surprised they didn’t swap bottas & Lewis and use him to hold the others up to extend Lewis 5 secs.. hope it stays that way!  4 restarts and Lewis in DRS and didn’t let him past, bravo bottas"
Sim racers earned their places today
LANDOOOOOOOOOO
McLaren WCC contenders now
How did Charles pull that off in that sandbag of a car
"PODIUM BABAY, who recycled the script from last year?"
IT WAS WORTH THE RACE
The race was going into a little bit of a lull halfway through. What a finish tho. Well worth the wait! Incredible race!
Great race to start the season. Very impressed with McLaren's performance
"I decided to get back into formula 1 after not watching for like 15 years. That shit was wild, and while I know this wasn’t typical, I don’t know why I ever stopped watching"
LANDOOOOOO
"I need to settle down, what an incredible race to start the season"
Lando podium is still less surprising than Ferrari being on there
"Kudos to Bottas, good win for him"
"What a race that was, hopefully more of the same next weekend."
Fuck it's nearly 1am here but there is NO CHANCE I am sleeping any time soon after that.
Race of the year?
Hamilton could've got podium points had he let Albon through. Not no one's got anything.
Leclerc browses r/PrequelMemes confirmed
Love you guys mclaren always make me proud 🧡
"I know it’s typically been a battle between RBR and Ferrari but I really hope they team up and surpass Mercedes. As much as I don’t like Ferrari, I do like Leclerc."
oh theres the champagne cant have a f1 podium without spraying bubbly
"I have to say, I like this post race format"
I kind of like how they're doing stuff on the grid.  It feels very old school without too much production.  It's like okay you you and you won here's your trophies and champagne right here in front of your cars on the track you raced on TA DA.
That was fucking incredible.
"I dont think the orange mclaren masks fit very well, they are always adjusting them"
Ohhh Horner must be pissed
"It was like a wet race , without the rain ! more please."
"Fuck this sport honestly. 

Another 10 win merc season. 2022 cannot come fast enough."
Latifi doing a F2 simulation back there
Shouldn't Albon be in thrid?
Fuck sake perez give that spot back
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME HAMILTON
VALTTERI WDC CONFIRMED. LEWIS IS TO OLD
MOM!  He's getting on the curbs more than me!
So glad Hamilton didn't end up with a podium after that.
"Let’s go, finally it’s lights out time ! To quote Kimi “fucking finally”"
"After watching all of the support races this morning, F1TV decides to die right before the main event. No PLC for me :("
Inb4 Hamilton spins Albon again
Valtteri doing the typical drive as fast as he can and have no tires left in 5 laps
"Gentemen, a short view back to the past..."
Aaaand it’s a Merc 1-2.
"OMG verstappen, I'm heartbroken"
Congrats Mercedes 2020 WCC champs
Vettel can't overtake a broken racing point lmao
"> vettel overtakes someone

""clearly a mechanical issue""

	#roasted"
"VER retiring fucks up the entire season. He was pretty much the only one with a sliver of a chance at beating Merc, and on such a short season losing 25pts is a big deal."
both haas cars have spun. F1 is really back
Haas is basically West Ham
Vettel why... Same mistakes every time.
Vettel lmao what a plonker
F1 is really back now lol.
Thats one for the spin compilation
"Can we point out that Russell is in 12th atm.

Hoping he can get himself a points finish."
"I don't think Vettel was going for that gap, just Sainz slowed much more than normal because of Leclerc cutting him of.  
Can't really fault anyone for that, Vettel should maybe have been a bit more attentive."
What is Latifi doing ?
"Mercedes: ""we will soon turn both cars down""

next lap: purple everywhere.

They are taking the piss."
The one time they don’t wanna show the Mercs is when they’re less than a second off each other?
Lewis is having a casual Sunday drive. Dude isn't even phased. Biding his time waiting to pounce
Is a little bit of chaos just too much to ask for? Come on guys 👉👈
Please to keep championship alive by killing both Mercs
Waaghh waaaghh bottas use moar kerb than me! Toto do something!
Lewis sees conspiracy? Oh how hilarious it would be if both Mercedes retired due to sensor issues.
Is the director showing anything other than the boring Mercedes procession?
Hopefully this doesn't spare Mercs gearboxes
"by the end every merc engine will be dead. Albon first win confirmed

Edit: this didn't age well"
Give Alex the place
Yo imagine if both mercs DNF. I’d fucking CUM
fuuuck he just had to wait for DRS
"Lewis' fault, IMO"
Hamilton does it again 😭😭
He can't kept getting away with this!!
5s penalty for ruining someone's race after getting passed... What a fucking joke
Bottas slowing down ham so the point gap at the end of the championship is less for him.
Leclerc 2nd is brilliant as well.
Button your pants are too tight Bro lol
Really feel for Albon :(
Charles just showed great composure. Calm and not panic in a car with no pace. Great race.
Racing Point are going to be fuming that Perez sped in the pitlane... amateur penalty
Love this podium celebration. Feels old school in the best way possible. Simple and intimate
"Dude, fuck Hamilton so much"
"Roses are red, violets are blue

Redbulls are broken, Mercedes 1-2"
How great would it be if bottas and Hamilton took each other out.
I am praying for merc gearbox failure.
Goddamn it Hamilton. What the fuck did Albon do to you?
"If Ferrari get a podium, I swear to God, they don't deserve it at all."
How much more space can you give a 6 TIME WORLD CHAMPION AND HE STILL CRASHES INTO YOU?!? HAMILTON WTF
Perez should give albon the place back.
Great showing from Lando and Leclerc. Bottas did great as always. Gutted for Albon. Hamilton can get fucked.
Charles gonna get that shitbox to the podium
How many times has Hamilton done this shit in his career.
Leclerc is kind of legend considering he got to P2 inspite of Ferrrai's troubles.
"Ferrari is red. 

Red Bull is blue. 

Get in there Lewis.

Mercedes 1-2."
"Merc pls go curbs, curbs go weee"
"Can we see something other than Mercedes please, this is getting boring"
Checo be cheating!!! That's Albon's point!!!
[Called it](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/hlm6s5/2020_austrian_grand_prix_race_discussion/fx014g0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
It is insane to me that F1TV still doesn't work. At this point I have no other choice but to cancel that service.
Brindle giving up on McLaren a little quickly... he got passed by a Red Bull and a Merc.
"Just like this, it's another Merc 1-2. I'm already done with this season."
They sure regret giving max the good front wing too lol
I’ve been trying to digest what just happened but all I can say is I’m absolutely shattered.
"Which engine is the worst, find out next time on Dragon Ball Z"
At this rate Ferarri could get on the podium. It's not like they are likely to break down with how little power their engine appears to be producing.
Why can’t HAAS have nice things?
It's like the stars are aligned for Hamilton to go and win this. Bottas has a decent lead and boom a safety car and all the hard work is gone
Why did he go for that Vettel you imbecile
hehe Carlos... Vettel does Vettel things again
How embarrassing 😭
Spinbastian Inevitable
If LEC puts that Red pig above P6 he deserves the Italian Prime minister spot.
Inb4 Lewis annihilates Bottas with a detuned engine
HELLO?! RACE DIRECTION?!?! BATTLE FOR THE LEAD???
God just kill me now I’m watching a Mercedes procession again
The Renault onboard cam SCREAMS
Latifi making people reconsider kubicas pace
MAXIMUM PACE LETS AGOOOOO
That meant you have to let Lewis pass
I never want to listen to the Renault again. That is the single worst engine note I've ever heard. I really hope the microphone is broken because I can't stand having to listen to that garbage for an entire season. I hope Ocon retires before they decide we have to watch his pov again.
Jesus this is back to 2014 Merc dominance.
Vettel has been trailing a Williams for 20 laps just about LOL
Imagine the state of the sport where the Mercedes can afford to slow down with 30 laps to go.
"So this is what makes F1 exciting, a dodgy track? Maybe Bernie was onto something when we wanted sprinklers. You know what, let's unleash marbles at random points too."
Ok if Seb manages to get back in the points I will be very happy lmao
"Perez getting greedy, he needs to give the position back."
"FIA knew this will happen this weekend, that is why there is a do-over next weekend"
Mercedes 1-2 crash and I will never complain about a boring race ever again.
"Albon was ahead and got cut off, Hamilton should get a penalty. As Martin said, needed some patience had him with the new tyres"
Hmm racing incident that one I think.
"New fan here, so what did I miss here? He didn’t give him enough room on the outside. How would that not be a penalty?"
Fuck Hamilton
CHARLES EFFECTIVE P2 LETS GOOOOOOOO
For those saying HAM left space - the gravel doesn't count...
NORRIS PODIUM BOIS WE FUCKING DID IT
I’m fucking pumped for Charles and Lando but George could’ve gotten points :(
does that count as a kneeldown for bottas?
"For all that chaos, props to Bottas for keeping his cool! Top drive!"
"The Ferrari has potential, if those Hungary upgrade's help the engine and drag that car could be really competitive."
Was that a B-24?
[deleted]
"What a weird year its been, and it's not even over."
First ever race that I'm watching live. Hope it's a good one! HYPEEEE
Bottas and Verstappen are crashing and Lando is gonna walk away with it mark my words
How about that chopper flip?!
That feeling when an illegal stream works better than an official F1 app....
For anyone whose F1TV isn't working - ESPN stream is working fine
Fuck I missed the pre race butterflies let’s gooo
Why are sky ignoring that Alex doesn’t have the upgrades
It’s been so long I forgot we start at past 10. Was thinking it’s 00 why aren’t they going
Hopeful for Norris starting p3
I just hope Lando gets a clean start and doesn't leave the door wide open for Alex
"If the the pre-season virtual testing has taught me anything:

Max and Lando collide

Albon is going to shout ""Jawwwarge"" while lapping Russell and getting taken out."
I've seen shady pornowebs have better streaming services than F1TV ffs
I’ve missed this so much....
"Oh hey, F1TV is a complete and utter shitshow. This ought to be considered fraud now. No refunds, no service, no customer care, they can all get fucked with a hot, rusty, sideways Ferrari."
The “Pinnacle of motorsport” cant even have a proper and reliable working streaming service. What a joke.
I'VE MISSED HEARING YOUR INTROS CROFTY
Lets fucking goooooooooooooooooo
We are waiting the magical words: Its lights out and...
cant get f1tv to work on desktop or mobile.  why the fuck am i paying $100 a year for this
So is ESPN showing commercials now?
"Thanks F1TV, going back to sleep."
"I don't own a car, but it's time to make my yearly payment of gratitude to Mother's Polish."
"ESPN, what the fuck?"
He just forgot Perez lol
217 days of pure torture
Guys Leclerc is starting along side his future teammate.
So they've got spots in the graphics for 21st and 22nd place.
217 days waiting for F1...
"Russell's pic always looks so innocent compared to the ""I'm a serious fighter!"" ones that most have"
Seb does not want the drincc
"Enjoy, all."
Formation lap incoming!!!!!
When illegal streams are more reliable than F1 TV.
Anyone else have a link? F1TV is garbage
if only i could watch the rece since f1tv is shit
HYPE!! My body is ready
Feeling very hopeful about McLaren/Lando/Future Danny Ric right now.
Ooh Formation lap!! Haah
I cannot believe we're finally going racing again!  It feels so good to be back!
I hate F1TV
Apparently F1TV is now hosted on Geocities
404 nice stream Liberty
"**IT IS TIME**

LIGHTS OUT AND AWAY 

WE

**FUCKING**

#GO!!!"
Bottas is fucking GONE
Fuck f1tv. Im at sea so need to watch with app. But these fckin errors get error code 2.3.1. F1TV big group of clowns. 100 + cant Even watch
Perez got mad elbows
F1TV is not working again :(
Wow Bottas is immediately running away with it.
"Perez muscling off the two Ferraris. Imagine that happening last year, haha."
Rofl mercedes goes 🚀
Bro how is bottas half way home already
And Bottas is gone!  Holy shit.
Bottas 👋🏻
" Jesus Christ, Valtteri has fucking disappeared"
"F1TV doesnt work for me, nice"
i want my $10 back f1tv
Valtteri got a dream start
"Leclerc: move I need to go forward

Perez: no no you are midfield now"
Jesus fuck Bottas
The Racing Points just farting along...
Goddamn that Merc is fast. Great start Lando.
Bottas: Aight imma head out
The gap to Bottas already lmao
That gap wth
So many cars are going wide at turn 1.
The Merc is flying...
Mercedes being Mercedes... What a great car Bottas has
RB on medium easely driving away from a Mclaren on softs though.
Holy shit Bottas gone
Lando for podium MAKE IT HAPPEN
Bottas is so good on this track
Mercedes not using das and still 3 seconds ahead.
Is F1 TV down? Can access the site.
Damn there goes the mclaren.
Ferraris are absolutely nowhere
Williams 19-20 😞😴
All I want is an Albon podium 😩
F1 TV down ... again. Why do I pay for this garbage
Verstappen honestly is not doing too bad. Keep in mind he's on the medium tyre.
Smoking point lol
Guys Mclarens race isn't with Merc and RB just yet. Great qualy but the real race is with RP
"Who would have thought, Hamilton not 1st and the camera man is still focusing on him..."
Norris : (
Feel like it's a nice time to start supporting Racing Point
Perez will pass Norris in next 2 laps
"I can deal w Albon, Ham getting past Norris. 

its a Red Bull and Merc after all.."
WTF is going on with F1 TV?!
Albon’s rear view mirror gotta be terrifying
Mercedes flat out using cheat codes at this point
I wanted a lando podium so bad
That Ferrari engine Sound :(
"LIFT ME UP LIFT ME UP

HIGHER NOW RARAMBA"
"That was a crazily even start, everyone got the exact same launch."
"Welp. I guess I'll go fishing, stay off the internet, and wait for this to be done. Thanks F1TV."
Albon probably thinking of Brazil 2019 right now
Merc also smoking
Mercedes dominance really scares me
"In quick summary what is the difference between the tires? Is it from soft to hard and fast and not durable to slow and durable or what?

Edit: thanks everyone!"
Looks good for Max if he can keep his distance to Bottas on harder tyres
Is that normal all the smoke from the Merc engine?
"Gutted for Lando, his podium is pretty much out of the window straight away. Kinda expected though with Albon, Lewis and Perez behind him"
Albon has some solid pace
 I bet this will be such an amazing season for Alex Albon
"Is it just me or have the Ferrari onboard cameras sounded weird all weekend?

Is that a new exhaust note, or is it just the mic, do you think?"
So our only hope for a challenge to Mercedes is cleary RedBull this year
Albon is doing what makes a good 2nd driver
Albon :(
Show the fucking midfield
"""Back"" in 6th and 9th? That's where they qualified…"
Jesus these Mercs are unstoppable
Leclerc is fully dropping back from racing point......
"LIFT ME UP LIFT ME UP

HIGHER NOW RARAMBA"
Holy the Mercedes is FAST FAST
"We get it racing point, you vape."
Ya'll just jinxed Albon
Leclerc in free air is 1.2 s slower than Bottas! Damn.
Mercedes and Red Bull easily overtaking the midfield teams within two laps while Leclerc isn't even close to being in Perez' DRS window. Damn.
It looks like Ferrari is competing in the Formula 1.5 this year
YES my boy catching the Ferrari!!! GET IN THERE RICCO
"F1 stewards: “3 position penalty”

Hamilton: “Ok lmao bye”"
Oh shit
RED BULL NOOOO000000
Jesus it's like that car had an extra 100HP!
Honda strikes again
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!
Mercedes 1-2 😔
"LOSING LOSING POWER

IT'S BWOKEN"
MAX:(
Max is fuming.
The Power of Dreams
Aaaaaaaaaand its a Merc 1-2 lovely
And HAM right back into second.
Race over. Merc 1-2 :(
Fucking hell. The season is over.
fuck that sucks for rb
Mercedes 1-2 confirmed
Wow Red Bull really is replacing Ferrari.
Great ...just fucking great ..
OMFG Max NO
giving Merc the win on a silver plate :(
"Run from it, hide from it. Mercedes 1-2 still arrives"
Amazed they’ve not told him to pull over.
"F for Max. Bad luck, I was looking forward how he will do on the opposite strategy."
Congrats to Mercedes on yet another 1-2.
Merc laughing their way to more championships
fucking lol I missed F1
ugh lando needs to get the pace
Happy for Albon!
The only thing I was looking forward to was Lewis having to overtake Max.
Friendship ended with Verstappen. Albon is my new friend
VERSTAPPEN GONE HOLY FUCK
Have you tried turning it off and on?
THAT’LL DO IT FOLKS
Fucksake it's not gonna be another season like this again huh...
Fucking anti stall
It's over. Mercedes 1-2
"VTEC just broke it, yo."
Damn sucks for him.
God fucking damn it I wanted that Max Vs Lewis action!
Albon on the podium will be a dream for me
Max is a bit cursed sometimes. :/
 Netflix must be so glad they did RBR this race
yoo both the ferrari's in top 10
Well this is anti climactic.... Let's hope something interesting happens
I could go back to sleep now...
netflix better be allowed in the garage
Austria = Ver and anti stall. Damn it there goes the race with Merc 1 2
That Ferrari is so slow on the straights
Such a sad sight being pushed back in
"Mercedes 1-2

Back again"
That’s what I get for putting $5 on Max
Bloody Mercedes
max :(
Mad Max!
Ok so now we will have Merc 1-2 but who will get their first podium? Norris or Albon
The battle between RP and McLaren is really interesting.
Dread it. Run from it. MERCEDES still arrives.
"Mercedes 1,2.

How unexpected."
"PSA: F1TV seems to be back online, for anyone wondering"
"Imagine waiting all this time to get racing, starting on the front row only to get fucked by your own PU not even 15 laps in"
GG Mercedes/Lewis. See you next year for your 8th championship.
guess alex can have that wing
"run from it, dread from it...

merc 1-2 still arrives"
Can count the overtakes after lap 2 on one hand sadly...
"Damn, Max. Damn."
fuck 2020
"You've got it all to do now, Alex"
What a weird failure. I don't remember ever seeing a car's software just completely malfunction like that.
Existence is painful
Stroll and Danny: Welcome to F1.5 Seb!
"Back to watching old seasons in full, early 2000s when I cant remember the results"
Nightmare situation for Max Verstappen
Vettel has temperature issues with engine or brakes?
Ferrari can’t even pass a tracing point with an engine problem
Mercs walking away now. Typical
When is Merc leaving F1 please?
bets on mercedes lapping VET?
Lmao Ferrari can't pass a RP even when RP has engine problems
Can’t believe I woke up this early to see an East Mercedes 1-2 🙃
Now 3rd place will be 1st place in our hearts since we all now that it will always be a mercedes 1-2.....
Bottas is my MD in the fantasy F1 thing. I honestly have no idea what MD is.
Ferrari clown picture. 7th and 10th
This ain't what we needed after such a long racing drought.
A racing point down on power and a healthy Ferrari can’t get past... sad
Merc 1-2 lmao. Hope Bottas wins at least.
Ferrari slower than a pink Mercedes with engines problems lol
What. Ferrari is slower down the straights than a crippled 2019 Merc? Wtf!
Stroll with an engine problem and Vettel still can’t get pass wtf is that engine Ferrari
Watching paint dry or watching the rest of this race is actually a tough decision right now.
Please let Mercedes have made an unreliable engine. Only possible way this season will be interesting.
My boys:'(
"RIP 2020 F1 championship.

Austrian GP lap 1 - Austrian GP lap 10."
/r/formula1 on suicide watch...
Ohnoooo Ric
FFS wake me up in 2021
How long did I wait for F1 to finally start again... ? And then this. #boring
Nooo Danny
How unlucky can Ricci get? Jesus!
So far this is the race of attrition.
Haas are so invisible..
Renault go boom
it seems Covid19 has infected the F1 cars
all of the netflix favorites getting fucked
Ricciardo :( in before no one finishes the race
Is the heat making things be more breaky today?
Renault back doing Renault things
"At this point last season, who would have thought that a Ferrari passing a Racing Point would be so difficult?"
"1 Honda down, 1 Renault down. It's a Russian roulette of engine failures it seems."
rip stroll
"New Ferrari strategy, go slow and don't break the engine before the others"
VET going to banana skin his way to a podium
That's Cyril killing Ric's engine out of spite
"this is a nightmare, both Ric and Max"
fucking Renault gearboxes
This is 2016 vibes again. Mercedes 1-2 duel way ahead of the field.
Just cancel f1 this year
Ricciardo probably even happier knowing he won’t have to deal with this next season
Ferrari reliability wins the day?
Stroll gone too
Why does everyone I love break down T_T
Ffs
"*""Hurry up and get me the fuck out of this meme team"".*

\- Daniel Ricciardo, just now, probably."
"They need to retire Stroll, engine is toast"
"This feels like 2015-2016, I'm almost certain Bottas is actually just Rosberg in a mask, convince me otherwise. It's not like the competition can catch up to check that for us"
I get the Ferraris plan now ! Get the rest of the field retired and then win it lmfao
Man I feel bad for Lance
Ricardo and Verstappen with mechanical problems? Whatyearisit.jpg
Riccy just wanted to meet up with his old chum Verstappen for a chat
Would love to see Lando make the podium.
RIP Stroll's engine. Merc PU does seem a little less reliable.
Mercedes 1-2. It's good to see the world returning to normal again.
"Finally....after 21 laps, F1 TV is back, and its in 420p"
Here come the Grosjean jokes again. It's really like nothing has changed haha.
since these cars can be considered to be affected by covid does this mean austria is gonna record at least an extra 2 covid deaths today
Ayy the Williams are close enough to the midfield to take advantage of guys screwing up.
I think Ericsson hit him
Come on 2022
Aaaaaand grosjean off track. Ahhhhhh F1 is back!
"Sucks for Stroll, he actually got off to a great start."
"But hey, we got Alpha in the top 10!!!!"
PUs dropping left right and center lol
The Mercs are probably in Hungary rn lol
Ferrari playing 6D chess by hoping everyone else's engines blow up while theirs are too weak to do the same.
Gro is fucking back
"Grosjean, you do you."
Grosjean spinning off! Welcome back!
"Death, taxes, and Mercedes 1-2"
Grosjean doing Grosjean things.
Grosjean in the gravel. Fucking speechless.
Lewis taking small chunks out of Bottas' lead.
I'm probably watching F1 these days just to get the back info for the next Drive to Survive episode
Seeing how long the gravel stayed on Grojean's tires is a cool example of how sticky those tires are
Ah the mercedes special
FERRARI TACTICS LMAOOOO
What on earth is Ferrari doing lmao
Grosjean gonna Grosjean
"I thought I am going to enjoy this race today, I was so excited.
This is a shit storm, confirmed."
"Honda engine out, Renault engine out, Merc engine out. Looks like Ferrari invested fully into reliability LMAO"
I see they pulled a merc
"Ferrari practising the fake pit stop, look out Mercedes!"
"This attrition rate takes me back, haha"
Damn Ocon is rusty as hell
Ferrari doing a dummy pitstop? Lol
Mercedes domination again
\#essereMidfield
Mercedes 1-2. Good grief.
Romain doesn't help himself sometimes.
Austria track to the cars: welcome back phackaroonies
Did Ferrari.... not even pit? Who? Who do they think they're fooling lmao
Is it just me or is soft tyres comfortably doing 25 laps just wrong? These 1 stop races have been frustrating me for a long time
Jeez Hamilton now only 4 seconds behind...
I'm considering cutting out a piece of paper and sticking it over the 1 and 2 place spots in the top left of my TV for the rest of the season
What is that weird sound from Esteban's Renault? It sounds very ill.
Renault sound like a strangled vacuum cleaner
"I was so excited for the first race of the season, until I realised I have to rely on the stability of F1TV. Needless to say, the excitement is gone because I can't watch the race.

F1TV is an absolute fucking disgrace"
That Renault sounds horrendous
Ocon's engine sounds terrible.
what is happening
Bunch of vankers
"Kevin, that's a right turn, not left"
What a weird crash
"Turn? What turn?

- Magnussen"
Brake failure?
Haas having their traditional first race shitshow
That looked like a Haas that stepped on the brakes and nothing happened.
Safety car
SAFETY CAR
Haha I see Gunter in DTS season 3
That's a Hamilton win then
Haas are a fucking joke lol (guessing something was wrong on Magnussen's car)
Mercedes is racing in a completely different league
Haas with brake problems lmao I wonder if someone is gonna fuck smash a door now
brake failure?
"They have the mic really close to the engine intake on that Renault, sounds great! Bwwwwuuuuucccccc"
"Raikkonen proving to have the worst luck ever yet again.

Pitstop. Immediate saftey car."
Renault power unit sounds like it has a bunch of bees in it
Classic Haas moment
Just forgot the corner. Happens to the best of us.
Feel so sorry for Haas. The worst always happens to them
Ahhh a double stack already! This is just showing off now.
“Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee” - K-Mag’s car flying off track
[deleted]
At this rate Latifi can get a point
"Safety car works for Bottas more than Ham. Without one Bottas probably pits early, Ham goes 10-15 laps longer and then has great pace at the end. With a safety car both will pit same time, Ham might even lose position with stacked stops and won't have a tire advantage late in the race.

Nah, safety car didn't catch them and bunch them before they could pit."
F1 Battle Royale
Fucking flawless
I fucking love the merc double stacks
Unsafest of unsafe releases
That was close
"Well, looks like rooting for Alex to get his first podium is all I’ve got left."
Straight penalty for racing point.
If anyone but a Mercedes wins then I'll legally change my name to Callum Callum
Magnusson actually did a terrific job of stopping the car without going into the gravel or hitting the wall tbf
Code brown alert for Lando
Why not a VSC?
lovely double stack
Lol the Sauber mechanic
Could that be an unsafe release?
Merc are so good at those double stops. I mean they're good at everything but they did one last year (China?) that was just so smooth.
Well there goes any strategic influence on this race.
"I think that’s gonna be no penalty, just"
Verstappen's season is basically already over lol
Easy penalty (or team fine at least)
Perez going for that 4D strategy with the mediums.
"I don't get that from Racing Point - they went for the mediums to get an advanced on the restart, didn't need to risk unsafe release"
inb4 Unsafe release penalty
Russell for points potentially?
LET US SE DAS
Perez on the mediums could be interesting on the restart.
Time for an Albon revenge
two seconds ted...
Safety car just fucked raikkonen right?
Bet my balls that Hamilton will destroy Bottas
Poor Bottas. His lead is gone.
Perez on Mediums
Safety Car faster than williams
Netflix is getting so much good content already.
Electrical issues but I thought it was powered by Honda not Volkswagen
If Perez wants a podium this tyre is the only choice tbh
Perez alone on mediums
That Williams is too sexy to be this slow :(
"Well... Normally, they get the reliability issues in Australia... Not Austria."
51°C track temp!? What!?
Hey Racing Point did something different with Perez...wonder hoe that is going to work out
Is it typical to have this many mechanical issues?
"BOTTAS USING DAS TO HEAT TYRES CONFIRMED  
  
edit: HAMILTON TOO"
Good save by Magnussen
"Kinda bummed, I wanted to watch Hamilton take Bottas on pace alone"
Ballsy strategy for Perez
"Seb’s ready for these hard tires, he ran a full race sim on them in fp2"
"They should only release lapped cars if there's enough time to do it (when clearing the track takes longer), otherwise just get racing asap."
"ReBottas.exe

EXECUTE DAS.exe"
Williams 3 places from the points? What is this life??
Bottas front right okay? Is that just normal flabby parts?
"Duel Access...Axis System

Nice one"
"Poor Magnussen. He was doing pretty OK this race.

He'll be taking to the sea this week for sure."
"Even if it ends with Merc 1-2, I’m just happy to see F1 back."
Would be cool to see Ocon snag a point or two in his first race back. I always liked the guy
Bottas' front right looks way worse than I'd expect this early
I won’t pretend to understand DAS but it sounds fucking cool
All 4 engine suppliers have had reliability issues
C'mon Norris and Albon!
"Come on Norris, come on Perez!"
"*snorts* ""Opening race of the season and DAS is the first time we've seen DAS"""
Safety car may have saved Ferrari from being lapped.
"Yes, having Lewis right behind Bottas with 41 laps to go totally plays right into Vallteri's hands /s"
"“Valteri, it’s James”

Just wait for it."
You're telling me that if I dropped a water drop on the track it would *boil away*???
VETTEL SPINS
There it is. SPIN
FOR FUCKS SAKE
S🅱️inella
OMEGA SPIN
Lol of course
What the fuck is this season?
What the hell was that from Seb?
omg! vettel!
SPIN JOKE HERE
sbin
Oh Seb what on earth...
Vettel can't get a rest eh?
After that spin this race is complete now.
 S B I N A N N A L A
Albon and Norris are looking great out of the gate this season. Really rooting for Albon this year.
Russell in 12th!!!
"Yeah, no idea what Vettel was thinking there."
"Dread it, run from it, Vettel still spins."
Absolutely amateur from Vettel
"Max and Danny out, Mercedes 1-2, SEB spinning... this is just 2019 2"
HAHAHAHAHAHA WHAT IS HAPPENING.
FFS Seb. 😢
SBINAAAAAALLAAAA
SEB IS BACK :D
Vettel DGAF Mode ACTIVATED
2020 is just not happening for some of us
First race first sp*n
He was spinning before he hit him. 🤦
Welcome to the Formula 1 season guys
"Another time to argue how moving over on another car on the straight is NOT ON

Leclerc edged Sainz off the track before the Vettel incident and it was fucking dangerous"
That was such a dumb move by Vettel.
Vettel should just call this car Kylie Minogue
Of course Vettel spun. The single normal thing in 2020.
That's why you get your contract terminated.
Oh yeah gotta love some Seb spins
Vettel Boomed
at least he managed to avoid ruining Carlos race
"Why the fuck is Latifi so far behind after the restart? 

Was he not part of the pack at the restart?"
"Damn, that was a nice overtake by Perez."
Sainz leaves Vettel in a spin!
Who had Vettel running 2 spots behind a Williams on their Bingo card?
Latifi is ridiculously slow
Sainz chasing his future partner and resulting in the guy he's replacing spinning. If that's not destiny having a laugh I don't know what is.
Perez with the easy overtake
If Perez can make those tires last he might nab a podium.
Damn checo
Anyone else notice that Russel is getting close to point!!???!
Mercedes is already 4 seconds ahead -.-
Mission Spinnow
Looks like the to/McLaren duel will be fun to watch this season
Perez planning on riding the mediums to the end? Pretty ballsy
Legit just depresses me at this point.
Pierre in eighth position - on track to be the highest scoring Alpha Tauri of all time!
"Poor Sainz, imagine chasing your “top team” ride for next year and your current teammate is ahead of your future one."
At what point will Hamilton fear for his tyres
Merc neutering the race already?
"Ferrari man, it sounds like a Vespa."
Vettels decline is worse than Arsenal's
"MULTI-21, Lewis"
Come on Russel! Come this far ...
They say you cut the course
Dont call team orders first race
Where is Ted? Is he sitting all by himself on the main grandstand?
Is it too late to bring back Kubica?
4-5 more laps before Ham passes Bottas. This all so cliche.
Sainz must be having second thoughts.
REAR VIEW MIRROR
What the fuck has happened to Latifi by the way?
Hand Merc the titles now and don't let them race the rest of the season. Would make F1 pretty damn good then.
I’m getting serious 2014 season flashbacks watching the 2 Mercs dart off from the field after a safety car
The virtual mirror in the halo is a nice touch.
Love that rear view mirror camera on the halo
Merc 1-2-3? Taking domination to another level entirely.
There are a tonne of infographics on the screen this year in comparison to last year
Rear camera addition.  Nice.
"🦀🦀🦀 Take my strength, George 🦀🦀🦀"
ah yes i wanna see leclerc onboard only..
I’m sorry but imposing team orders in the FIRST race of the season is silly. Let them fight.
The biggest problem Mercedes has to deal with is deciding which of their drivers they'll allow to win this race
Liberty Media have done so much to improve the presentation of races.
Jesus the Ferrari sounds awful.
"Yo that rear view mirror, pretty cool"
"The camera shots are so shit, show us the Kyvat battle!"
Charles Leclerc - a nice juicy bit of ham
Fingers crossed for a Williams point
What happened to stroll? I must have missed it
Vettel and Kimi fighting again at similar spots...
The onboard mics sound pretty average on some of the cars.
i know we wanted more midfield camera time... but umm.... can we see the leaders please?
Russell getting a point would be amazing. Really hope a top seat opening up for him will come sooner rather than later
gonna be hard to get used to Ferrari chasing McLaren
Why does the Renault sound like crap? Like it has one of those ebay electric superchargers
Is the Renault using a blender as an engine? What was that sound?
The Ferrari seems better than Mclaren into the corners. Lecrerc can always pull a decent gap before the straights.
"That reno on-board is genuinely unpleasant, that noise is fucking horrendous."
Renault sound very shit onboard
Russel is only 2 engine problems away from getting points!
looks like Hamilton is slowing down to have mercy on his car
"They've not showed him, so I've only been able to follow on the grid graphic, but Imimpressed by Russel! Sure, he's had some help with the DNF's, but close to the points!

If there's a battle there, I really hope that they show it."
Multi 21
"Maximum pace

Forever?"
F1 2019 DRS train effect is real today.
Imagine if the Mercs took eachother out lmao
"Come on Hamilton, at least make this 1-2 somewhat interesting."
Ocon and Ricciardo sponsored by DP world. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
COME ON NORRIS YOU BEAUTIFUL MEMEY BASTARD
"""Please stay off the kerbs""

finally, you know those a killer"
"Bono: Lewis, Multi 7744, confirm please

Hamilton: *radio silence*"
I like to imagine there's a whole security force dedicated solely to keeping Martin off the track
Sensor issues for Mercedes this could get spicy...
Don't do that. Don't give me hope
"If the Mercs take each other out, Williams get a point. ;)"
Bottas is way better out the corners but the drs + slip is so strong
Someone needs to upload a video of the Mercedes driving together with no others near them while some leisurely music plays
Toto looks mildly annoyed. They better not mess up his 1-2.
This reminds me of 2014 when the Mercedes ran off into the sunset with only each other to fight
"Show the midfield when the lead is unreachable.

Show the leaders when theres an actual battle

Its not rocket science people"
"He's been under 1s for like 10 laps, they keep saying ""he's under 0.6 seconds!"""
I swear to God if you break these cars...
Lando is the only bright spot in this race.
Raikkonen has got ahead of Russell
good lord the Mercedes pace is insane
"Those two mighty black Mercs cruising alone,
what a demonstration"
Lol Lewis ain't buying it.
Bottas really needs to drop Hamilton out of drs range.
Such a mean looking livery for what is effectively the greatest F1 car of all time from what we've seen
"Got to hand it to Lewis, he wants the win."
Stay off the curbs... both Merc’s allllll over the curbs😂
Albon probably hoping that the Mercs keep on attacking those curbs.
"How is Latifi that much slower than everyone else? I know it's his first season (but he was F2 so it's not like he's ""terrible""), and Williams isn't exactly the fastest, but GR is up in 13th so the car can't be that bad?"
Merc 10 seconds ahead of everybody else lol
Kerbgate
Bottas is going to be told off by Toto soon if he doesnt stay off the kerbs
Red Bull confirms electrical issues for Verstappen
This is great to watch. The team losing their minds while the drivers are playing chicken on the kerbs.
Ted just KNOWNS he's gonna get interrupted
The curbs are going to strike back aren't they?
With the same car Latifi is 20 seconds behind Russell. Jeez!
Empty grandstands :(. At least the director won't randomly switch to fans in the middle of a fight.
Can we get the interval gap FOM??
VALTERRI ITS JAMES
I wonder where all the other cars have gone
BREAK BREAK BREAK
IT’S JAMES
show some actual racing ffs
Oooh this is getting spicy
sTaY oFf ThE cUrBs
Will we get another overtake before the end of the race?
Please can the mercades fall apart
"""This is the red and white kerbs too Lewis""  lmao"
ALB PER NOR  is the absolute dream
J A M E S
Ooooh. I thought you meant the yellow ones. 🤣🤣🤣
This is all greek to me
“Even badder” lol Crofty
VALTTERI ITS JAMES. LEWIS ITS JAMES.
Imagine Albon-Perez-Norris if both mercs had to retire.
"please race gods, spice this up 👉👈"
"I don't generally mind TV coverage much, but can we please see any other cars for a bit?"
Pls curbs do this for us
"No it isn’t, it’s worse. Lmfao"
Can they fucking show something else other than these mercs in front fuck sake
Ia it just me or is merc again trying to create articial suspense by talking about non existant problems???
"ALB, PER, NOR podium incomming!"
"Mercedes: “we have an issue”

Also Mercedes: *fastest lap*"
"Over 10k comments in this thread, I'm so happy. F1 welcomed us all!"
FFS the mercs are crawling and still no bugger can catch them
"Alex, Checo and Lando 123?"
Mercedes/Hamilton always having issues or bad tires but still kicking it.
Welp...let's take a look at that midfield
"Bottas doesn't seem concerned... Also, can we see another car please?"
Albon first race win? Yes please
"Mercedes to both their drivers ""Stay off the kerbs!!!"""
Just see Vettel trailing a Williams. What have you done Mattia ?
Ferrari is racing a Williams! GRAZIE RAGAZZI CHE GIRO!
Vettel against Russell is unexpected but surprisingly fun lol
[deleted]
This merc footage is boring AF. Let’s see some mid table
These Mercedes engineer communications are the most entertaining part of the race!
"Damn, I was hoping to see Ferrari get lapped. Is that too much to ask Sbinotto?"
Haas rip
the classic Vettel vs Russel battle
What the fuck is wrong with the tv directors. All we are seeing in Bottas and Hamilton going round
Sebastian is still behind the Williams...
Crofty still can’t pronounce ‘Kvyat’ properly after like 6 years...
Grosjean running the Joker lap
"Christ, dude."
Typical G8
"James: stay off the red and white

TV producers: literally only showing the two cars basically not racing.

SMH"
Grosjean exceeding the track limits again.
"Honestly, I won't miss Haas"
Not Russell too ffs
Latifi not last!
VANKERS
Another Merc down as well
NOOOOO NOT GEORGE 😭😭
This is Albon's chancee
Nooooooo George
Full on chaos race
GRO lost his way.
Jesus every mechanical retirement this race is just so sad
SAFETY CAR TIME!!!
Haas looking like a bunch of fuckin wankers
"Halfway to one retirement from each team, boys"
SC again
Shit George. He was having a good run and now he's retirement 5.
sacrifice the williams for another safety car
RUS RIP
This track is wild on f1 cars holy
NOOOO Russell :(
Another SC?
nooo george :((
RACE IS ON NOW BOIS
Russel :(
what in the world in this race lmao
Fucking shit.
Come on safety car for max chaos
2 cars gone in 30s
If latifi gets a point before Russell I swear to god
"No Russel, I'm straight up not having a good time."
Albon might actually get the win.
Alex you better HAUL ASS
#Blessed
Jesus another Merc engine in the drain
Survival of the fittest today!
This is very hard for my mental health
Russell out. I'm going to go drink my misery away.
Is there no way for the commentators to see that a fucking radio transmission is about to play?
1 of every car must be sacrificed!
Alex please have pace
Mercedes are gonna drop Russell for that lol
NOOOOO George :( He drove so well. Heartbreaker for Williams.
"What the hell is going on?

Also, how bad is the new Ferrari engine? Seriously"
I can’t believe since Vettel’s spin he hasn’t moved up a place
This race is like a cars graveyard man
What is this race
Poor Williams :(
Merc trapped
WE LOOK LIKE A BUNCH OF VANKERS
Which is worse Mercedes reliability or Ferrari chassis?
Bro I am straight up NOT having a good time
Albon needs to push after this safety car.
I guess a perk of Ferrari building a tractor is that the car is pretty sturdy
"Interesting that Perez, the only driver on mediums instead of hards, doesn't pit"
"Another one.....

*oh wait*

Another one!!!"
LANDO on Mediums.  LETS GO
Albon P1 hype train
No way Mercedes will be faster then Red bull on soft
WE'RE ROOTING FOR YOU ALEXANDER
Albon time bois
"ALBON GOT ON SOFTS, HES OUT FOR BLOOD LETS GO I WANT TO SEE SOME DANK BATTLES!"
"Mercedes 1,2,3"
Albon's pulled a blinder here.
i love the completely blank red Ferrari fin
This is going to get spicy
Albon got a chance on green flag
RUSSELL DIED SO THAT ALBON MAY LIVE
Albon (and Norris) will be racey!
"Gutted for Russell, heartbreaker"
Why didn't Perez stop?
This is about to get spicy
I doubt Albon will come close to challenging Hamilton and Bottas but i'll be happy if he can surprise me
Thats a lot of people Hahahaha
SPECTATORS
Checo tire God time
There's more people in that spot now!
WARBON ON THE PATH
If Perez-Albon get on the podium I’ll fucking scream
Mercedes became so dominant they’re 1-2-3 now
McLaren giving Carlos the Ferrari strategy welcome
18 laps to go with new reds vs used hards. I think Albon has a real shot here!
I’m becoming a horner fan. He seems to make a lot of gutsy calls.
"RedBull Ring curbs, brought to you by Rich Energy"
Just watch how suddenly the sensor is not a problem anymore.
"If both Merc retire, and we get a Perez-Albon-Norris podium, this’ll be the best race in a very long while."
"If the tRacing Point wins, I’ll take back this race being called boring 🤣"
"Albon is in a pretty good position, let's hope he give us some action"
"Albon and Lando on fresh tyres, Mercs with possible mechanical issues, this could still get spicy"
On my knees for an albon win.
Vettel still P13.
CMON ALBONO ESKETIIIT
Let’s go Albon P3 minimum!
bernd mayländer for driver of the day
FUCK
What the actual fuck
Safety car showing off to the Merc's that he's allowed on the kerbs.
That restart speed was craaaazy
LOL THERE IS THE TRACK HAZARD. KIMI 😂😂😂
Damn this race is a shit show
If 2020 were a Formula 1 race...
Oh for fucks sake
Latifi Point hype.
":( Alex needs more time, not another SC :("
wtf Raikonnen
Omg wtf happened to Kimi wow
Wow the front just fell off
"Tyre comes off 

Crofty: MASSIVE CRASH"
Kimi wanted ice cream
Tire need drink
Albon had Perez there. So we know how that’ll go.
That was a massive failure for Kimi
Albon what in the fuck was that. That was... beautiful!
Did kimi laugh on the radio lol?
This race is so 2020
Looking like Aussie 08 out here gang
You will not have the wheel
That was scary
Latifi a few more DNFs from points!
The front fell off
Absolute chaos
Holy shit how does Kimi sound so calm about that
That wheel said NOT TODAY FUCKERS I'M OUT
"Huge failure, frightening"
Pretty much all my favorite drivers are out lmao fuck this shit
What is the least number of cars to ever finish a race??
WE NEED A TRACK WITH AUSTRIA KERBS AND GERMAN DRAG STRIPS
/r/tiresaretheenemy
Albon was ahead of Perez
"That's not very typical, I'd like to make that point"
Wow 7 retirements
Perez should give that spot back no?
"Cool, Albon in P3 on fresher better tyres, but SC, so back in P4. You don't even get little things to go your way to somewhat challenge the Mercs today apparently."
where's the tether??
At this rate there will be only 10 cars finishing lmao
Imagine Max with new softs behind Mercedes..
I think Albon was already ahead
Fuck me good job there wasn’t a camera man there
"This race is just like 2020. Batshit crazy and anything that can go wrong, does go wrong."
“Drove the wheel of the car” - Martin Brundle
Kimi's tyre: SOCIAL DISTANCE!
Thank god the tire didn’t hit anyone
Just a grand conspiracy by the racing gods to get Latifi a point
Jesus that tyre just yeeted itself off
Alfa tire: “MY PEOPLE NEED ME”
"Drink, steering wheel and tire"
"Well it was a new set for Raikkonen. He had done a lap with them on, but didn't come off among that lap.

So not fitted properly, rim failure or wheel nut failure."
If Latifi scores and then George ends on 0 this season again I stg
Kimi take the wheel
Let's hope next week it's a bit hotter.
The front fell off
This is turning into one of these NASCAR races where there's a caution every two minutes.
What is this race lol
Seb was even baffled
Kimi's wheel just went in to do a pit stop all by itself
"That could have been extremely dangerous, this need to be looked upon"
Wth is this race
Sauber experimenting with pitstops at race speeds.
"""Kimi, you cannot have the tire."""
"I thought Brazil last year was nuts... Just, wow"
Albon should be 3rd
The various  replays of Kimi's tire going on a walkabout are meme gold
All the teams are conspiring to erase any Mercedes lead by using the safety car.
Front right wheel is giving Kimi McLaren flashbacks again
"Almost looks like the tyre lug wasn't right enough. I've seen it happen in NASCAR, but never that bad since they have 5 lugs"
"So now just Mercedes, McLaren, Ferrari and Alpha Tauri have both cars in the race."
"Raikkonen got screwd on the first safety car and now this

He was actually doing well"
Latifi could legit score a point in his first race in F1...
Ferrari is just awfully quiet here. No pace at all
From all cars finishing last season to this war of attrition
Curious to find out if that overtake was completed before the SC notifications.
Y’all see that one vid where Kimi recently said he was unlucky? Case in point.
So many mechanical failures.
The amount of retirements has been too damn high
why mclaren gave mediums to Sainz instead of softs? I don't see the point of choosing medium over soft with <15 laps left...
Focking vankers!
Any penalty for Perez for the unsafe release by the way ?
It's been a while since we had so many retirements. And all of them mechanical as well (if you count Raikonnen as a fault by a mechanic)
The retirement race
"come on I need racing, Albon needs laps!"
"Mercedes double retirement, Albon 1st?"
Kimi activated the rarely used Beyblade technique.
front right doing social distancing
So someone is getting in trouble in the Alfa pits
Vettel: chaos is a ladder
"Eh, Albon??"
FOM getting their money's worth from Maylander
ALEXX IS BACC
Can we confirm now that the ferraris were doing something grey with thier engines?
Why is the SC not in :(
THERE WE GO ALEX
Albonooooo
Yeah albon!
People did predict that things would be rusty...did not expect so many retirements though
YES ALBON
Alex mah boi do ya thing
Get the bloody safety car in
"oh Albon in 3rd on softs

this will be interesting"
Reminds me of an early 2000’s race with this many retirements
Inb4 the Mercs smoke the Redbull on old hards.
Ah fuck
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NOT AGAAAAAAAAIN
WTF
Ffs
Bottas started this re-start too early lol
omg nooooooooooooo
Lmao Hamilton fucking hates albon
Brazil 2.0
Fuck
Lewis is a Mofo
Good lord the drama is real today
NOOOOOOOOOOOO
"Latifi is going to get a point, calling it now.

Edit: 1 down."
LEWIS DID IT AGAIN
DAMN. IT.
Alex :(
Well that didn't work out
God dammit not again !!!
First race more like best race
Albon thought it was F1 2019 where you just ghost through each other.
"Poor move by Albon. Had the tyres and the pace. Chose the wrong corner. 

Brazil relived"
WHAT IS THIS RACE
Brazil flashbacks
Zero points for RBR. Devastating
This was on Hamilton or am I seeing this wrong?
NAH NO WAY AGAIN THE FKN BINGO CARDS THIS RACE
"That's gotta be a penalty, c'mon.

Albon could've won this...

ARGHGGGGG"
Cant believe Vettel is still only 10th
Norris podium dreams back???
Bad day to be a RB fan
Does Hamilton not like Albon or something?
The Mercs are indestructible
albon failed but atleast I am GLAD that RedBull have a driver who is going for it! Gasly would have never tried it. Albon is not scared to do risky moves. Love it
OMG how did that happen again???
So... will Red Bull protest?
This has to be HAS TO BE a penalty for hamiltoe
NORRIS PODIUM CHANCE ALERT
Really seems like Hamilton causes tonsof contact with others but never has it end worse for him.
"Nooooooooo, what the fuck everything seemed so calm"
Alex deserved that fucking podium
Hamilton's fault?
Heartbreaking for Alex... Fucking hell. Devastating.
Mercedes 1-2-3
"Not again. That's sooo rough. I don't know enough to say who's at fault, but I feel for Alex so much"
"The thing is, with 8 cars fucked, Vettel is *just* in the points"
"He left no space, Albon was ahead"
Penalty hamilton
Perez and Norris maybe racing for second
Ffs I don’t know what problem you’ve got with Albon Lewis
Omg. Alex... nooooooooooo!!!!!!
That. Is fucking gutting.
Carlos Sainz with some screen time finally
Hamilton penalty I guess
"The hell even is this race? I'm all for chaos but damn, chill Austria"
"Albon was way ahead when they touched, that has to be a pen. Gutted for Alex"
"Of all this chaos, Gio and Vet fighting is being overlooked lol"
"Deja Vu for Albon, so unlucky. Norris could be on for a podium here as well."
That was albons place. Hamilton was too aggressive on that defense
It's personal right? There's no way it's not gonna get personal.
Every restart Bottas just goes away..
Toto table smash incoming?
Come on landoooooooooooooo
At this point Hamilton's just going to engage rage mode for the sake of overcoming the potential time penalty.
7 retirements and vettel a still 11th
Great move by Leclerc
What? Ferrari can overtake?????
COME ON LANDOBOT!
Absolute spicy race... Love it.
Leclerc doing fastest lap? Did Ferrari just started their engine?
Leclerc is driver of the day with this Ferrari
Ferrari getting a podium here will be a surprise for sure! How the turn tables!
common norris!
GiovanAlfa passed Vettel? What is going on back there?
All the time you have to leave the space. Hamilton squeezed him with nowhere to go while albon was ahead already on track
These bastard's might get a podium somehow
Leclerc letting y’all know right now.
"We might have a really boring end to a super interesting race, Merc 1-2 and Leclerc 3."
oh look Leclerc around the outside and Norris managed to give room.
Ferrari looks a handful in dirty air
"That's a racing incident but Hamilton could've done more to avoid it.

It's the first lap of a restart and he's on old worn tires."
5 second penalty for Hamilton
Brilliant move from Charles
Hamilton penalty is ridiculous.
5 SECONDS TOO HOLY SHIT
Fucking Leclerc P2
"that ferrari engine doesn't sound very good either, almost like its trying too hard"
The kid is good
5 second penalty for Hamilton
Lewis is going to be 7th lmao unlucky
What a move Charles!!
Pérez not going to be able to hold him.
"Not only will Leclerc get on the podium, Ferrari will be miles ahead of Red Bull in the WCC (if Vettel stays in the points)"
Lol after all that and Leclerc within touching distance of a podium and an outside chance for a win
"Boys, P1 for Leclerc. You heard it here first!"
YASSSS Ham penalty
Leclerc pulling an Alonso 2014 here
Leclerc is making teh bathtub work
YES THANKS STEWARDS
Bottas wdc 2020
Good decision FIA
Lec is really something special isn't he
WTF FERRARI P2 I’M HYPED
Mclaren are in for a strong points finish but I'd love a podium
This shit is wild and I fucking love it
Norris pushhhhhh!!!!
5 seconds? That is a yoke!
That's fucking ridiculous that Hamilton only got a 5 second penalty. Complete joke
"Try telling Lewis to take it easy when he's getting 5 seconds added to his time. Really, Merc should let him pass Bottas so he'd only drop down to 2nd, so they hold onto the top 2 places."
Well at least the FIA did something about it with that penalty....five seconds though?  Fucking come on.
All part of the grand Ferrari master plan TM
LOL 5 seconds penalty is going to be an inconvenience to Lewis meanwhile Albon got fucked to 13th
So Bottas - Leclerc - Perez?
Albon just smoked past Vettel for 11th
"Somehow Ferrari (or rather, Leclerc) ended up doing quite well this race."
"BOT - LEC - NOR

Just as predicted"
The gearbox is working fine suddenly???
"I love Leclerc, but considering how shit Ferrari has looked this weekend, I was really hoping for Racing Point or Mclaren to sneak into the podium."
INB4 Merc switches the cars and activates Valtteri Roadblock to secure the 1-2.
Goddamnit lol
"Hahaha what the fuck. 

No perez has a penalty."
"Given the Mercedes’ speed, that penalty is almost worthless."
"Now Perez with a penalty?

What in the entire fuck is this race!?"
"lmao Perez too

Bottas - Leclerc - Norris would be so crazy"
COME ON NORRIS
What?  How long ago was Pérez in the pits?
"I never understood  this 5 second penalty. What good is this to Albon that he fell from 3rd to 12th? Bullshit regulations. Penalty should be 40 seconds to completely fuck his race, lets see if he does it again (I am not talking about HAM specifically here)."
Norris podium baby!
LANDO PODIUM HYPE!?
##blessed
PLEASE. FFS. LET IT HAPPEN.
Perez with a penalty???? Jeez
"5 seconds for fucking someone over completely.

10/10 Would do again."
An absolute clownfiesta
"Perez hasn't been in the pits for 40 mins, but magically has a penalty to keep ham in the podium"
Lando podium incoming!!!!
"As much as I'd love to see the Mercs go up in smoke, the replays really show no wrong-doing whatsoever by HAM.

Seems like the stewards are just as fed up with the Merc-dominace as everyone else..."
GICE NORRIS A PODIUM PLEASE
This is incredible
Albon inducing safety car to ruin Hamilton.
C'mon Norris
Come on Lando!!!
I'm fucking done this is insane
YES LANDO COME ON MILKMAN
COME ON LANDO
Everyone is nuts today I love it
Lewis .5
Vettel up to 10th!!! Amazing to see an underdog claw up into the points!
"You get five seconds, you get five seconds, everyone gets five seconds!"
Latifi has finished higher than George's best in his debut. What the FUCK
What the fuck is going on
5 sec is fair for ruining Albon's race.
we're about to have more cars out than in by the end of the race
9 retirements
"what the actual fuck

Latifi gonna get point before Russell lmao"
Wtf is happening
Omggggggg are we gonna gonna witness the milk boy holding champagne
Please SC
Latifi to the points pls
Latifi!!!!!!!
"damn, i don't recall seeing this many cars DNF"
Latifi top 10 c'mon!
WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING?
??????????? 11 left? What is this race even?
Pls podium for norris
8 cars out. WTF is this race
WE’RE GONNA BE RIGHT BACK HERE IN 7 DAYS BOIS
Hamilton still getting on the podium is BS.
Latifi plz
inject this into my fucking eyeballs
before the race I would have bet everything the track wasn't build on a native american burial ground but here we are
What the hell lmao
Spontaneous tyre failure is rare. Damn.
Yeaaaaa boiiiiiiii!
"Honestly though, 5 seconds is not enough for ruining someone's race without hindering your own."
LANDOOOO

"Bottas playing 4D Chess kicking Hamilton off the podium here. 

Those were probably one of the most randomly enjoyable last 10 laps in recent memory (up there with Brazil last year)."
This go cart race got a cool TV production !
MY BOOOOOOOY LANDOOOOO
 Lando you BEAUTYYYYY
Let's hold a moment of silence for all of those who announced they were tuning out after the first safety car.
LANDOOOOI
Norrriissssssssssss
LANDOOOOOOOOOO
Dammmnnn Lando
Go on Lando. Amazing. Bottas sounding like waluigi on the radio
"Hahaha, yes Charles"
I love this race so much
YES!!!
McLaren resurrection 3rd and 5th holy shit
Landoooooooooo
LANDOOIO
LANDO WHAT A DRIVE HOLY SHIT
I can't wait to see Ric in a McLaren next year. Their car was fast today. What a last lap by Lando.
We talked shit about Ferrari all weekend and they got 2nd. Ha
"LANDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

LANDOOOOO
The fun just keeps coming after everything yesterday.
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Holy shit what a final 10 laps
Lando!!!
OMFG Lando 3rd.
WHAT JUST HAPPENED
"Norris finishing exactly where he started, what a meme hahahahah"
Lando you fucking hero. What a lap! Edge of my seat for the last 3 what a fooookin lap!!
Good Job Lando you little legend
LANDO! What a champ! Fastest lap! Twitch streamer gets on the podium in a F1 race
Landoooooooo
Zak Brown is going to crush some Miller High Life tonight.
I am so fucking happy!!!!
Two consecutive McLaren podiums!
that race turned out pretty well in the end
"Happy for Lando! But man, Albon my man.. 9 cars retired jesus..."
"That was clutch af from Lando

Holy Shit"
Lando p3 YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS JUSTICE
"Good race for McLaren! 
GREAT race for Lando!"
Wow! Pipped at the post. Great work from Lando.
Zak Brown has done an exceptional job turning McLaren around
MCLAREN ON A PODIUM IVE WAITED FOR THISSSSSS 😭😭😭😭😭
McLaren second in the championship!?
Norris serving that JusticeForAlbon
LANDOOOOOOOOOO
Albon sacrificed himself for the greater good.
Norris a bit too excited knocking out that P3 sign!
WHAT AN INCREDIBLE RACE!
YOUNG LANDOOOOO
Hahhaha Norris absolutely slamming into the 3rd place sign. First time Lando?
Let’s GOOOOOOO
"Lando deserves this, McLaren deserves this. I am so happy"
Can I just ask...what the fuck just happened? Absolutely insane
All races should just be austria
Lando DoD
"""I don't wanna celebrate too much""

LMAO"
The fastest lap was the same time as last year.
Lando ramming the 3rd place
Lando don't give a shit about that 3rd place sign
LANDO’S LAST LAP🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What a race for Lando Norris man !! Amazing big achievement
All it took was 20 safety cars to kill 1 of the mercs and he even helped killing himself 🤷
YES!!! LANDO!!!!! :D
GG social distancing
The future of this sport seems in good hands with these lads.
Lando hit the 3 sign lol
“Tried to self-destruct”
Fucking awesome drive by Lando!
What a time to be alive!!! I can't believe it! Lando on the PODIUM!!!!
Alex :(
Two of my fav drivers on the podium it's been quite the race
And to think we’ll be right back here again next Sunday
I'm crying for Lando
This was like a fucking NASCAR finish.
What's going to happen next weekend. It was looking like a no brainer for Mercedes 1-2...
What a race!
LANDO MY BOY
Truly Bottas 3.0
Christian Hoerner on suicide watch /s
what happened to albon ?
see everyone back here next saturday morning for the next episode of wacky races
"As soon as the safety car came out for Russel, you knew shit was gonna go down."
As is usual Mercedes issues result in no retirement or dramatic drop off in pace. When was the last time they actually resulted in anything? Baku 16? Canada 16?
LANDOOOO
"WHAT A RACE, my poor heart!"
"Albon is the sacrifice for good races. Happened in Germany, happened in Brazil, happened today."
Holy shit what a hell of a race to start the season off!!! So happy for McLaren and Lando!!!!
I really like the Finnish national anthem.
bottas won because he is so cool under pressure. All those safety cars had no effect on the iceman
You have to love lando
"This is so beautiful, this moment is unforgettable"
Loving this podium
What. The. Hell. Happened here!
"Can we protest this shit against FIA?

5 secs penalty can't even compare with the first ever podium."
Just 5 seconds is BS for ruining the entire race of Albon 😩
Hamilton with the classic whataboutism
Amazing how fast an interesting season can end
Those Mercs weaving across the track behind the safety car just look *fake*. A real car should not be that planted. Absolutely bonkers stuff.
Imagine them both losing their gearbox! Yes please.
Give Hamilton a 5 second penalty.
"I mean after how eager the apology was in Brazil last year, one could expect HAM to have a little bit of decency and not do such an unfair defending move"
Red Bull Racing protests Red Bull Racing anti-stall
I could listen to Christian Horners tears all day long. Inject it.
Would love to see Latifi get past Vettel at least
 #FireDavidCroft
"God Sky are a bunch of clowns, almost making the point that Merc should let Hamilton win until the very last corner. Glad I'm not paying for this stupid British bias

EDIT: I get why they were saying it, but could he have gotten a 5 second gap in a couple of laps with a compromised car? I really doubt it"
"God, no audience members means there's a massive amount of sound absorption missing, and it makes the cars sound so LOUD I love it"
Merc should be banned from DRS to make races fair lol
"Lmao fucks sake Max, car shitting the bed and its not even 20 laps in"
lmao GP2 engine
"Max isn't in my Fantasy team

AMA"
Mercedes 1 2 confirmed
" Aramco and end racism on the same image...oh, the irony"
Same shit different year. Merc 1 2. See y'all next year
"So we never ended up getting a fourth top team to break up the same old, we ended up going down to one instead. This is going to suck hard and it’s not Mercedes fault."
The Ferrari can't catch Stroll when he has a fucking engine problem lmfao
"Ok, new story lines:  
  
- Does Lewis catch Valtteri?  
- Does Norris catch Albon?  
- Does Merc use the DAS to preserve tires?  
  
Haven't seen Merc use DAS yet."
i feel like even if you were a merc fan this shit has got to be so boring to watch
Grosjean off. What a suprise lol
God the Renault engine sounds atrocious
"Neither Ferrari lost a place in the pits, it's a miracle"
"The truth is, if we take Mercs out of the equation, we have a perfectly balanced race."
Shocking by Vettel
WTF are you doing Sebastian lol
Mission Spinnow
s🅱️inala
Awesome rear window graphic!
Have Alpha Tauri been shown once lmao?
Race shaping up as one of the worst at the Ring that i've ever seen. Bodes well for next week and the rest of this meme season.
valtteri it’s james
Bono my sensors are gone
nice to see Seb racing with Kimi again
"""but muuuuum. He did it too!"""
MERC PLEASE RETIRE YOUR CARS
"Both Mercs to retire and we get an Albon, Perez and Lando podium. 

Imagine the scenes."
Merc plz double retire for Lando podium
[removed]
Can’t wait for the new budget rules
Critical gearbox issues. NICE
We’ve had so many laps of only seeing Mercedes. This is really horrible directing. It’s got to have been 10 laps by now.
If verstappen was around this would be a very different race
Grosjean preparing for rallycross for when he gets dropped by Haas
Perez - lando - Albon ?
Albono23 you can do this.
JESUS WHAT IS HAPPENING
"How lucky is Mercedes pfff. Albon on softs looking like he could attack, Kimi's wheel comes off."
This second safety car probably saves Merc and prevents Albon from winning
"Regarding everyone saying ""WHAT IS HAPPENING,"" the first race of a normal season in Australia is also usually a mess."
I forgot about max Verstappen 😅
More safety cars than an iracing oval race
Why the fuco is the safety car is still out.
What the fuck Lewis
Lewis penalty surely
Hamilton deserves a penatly for that that was a clean overtake by Albon
Brundle is really incapable of blaming Hamilton for anything isn’t he
"Lewis’ fault that, that was Albon’s corner."
Has to be a penalty right?
"Damn, Alex should've waited for DRS"
2019 brazil fucking again
Does Lewis not know how to battle with Albon? He has 0 race sense when Albon is overtaking him. Another podium lost because of him
"Team orders McLaren, PLEASE"
"Good call on the penalty, that was subtly dirty from Lewis"
Lando Number 1 British Driver
Norris and LeClerc brilliant young drivers!
We all drink milk on this blessed day 🙏
That was the best worst race ever
Hot garbage mercedes
"honestly fuck lewis. look how much flack Vettel got for the contact with saint and lewis did something similar and brundle blames Albion. what a joke. good job on leclerc and lando to get him off the podium that he did not deserve. 

good job bottas"
"PEREZ NEEDS TO GIVE THE POSITION BACK FFS

IT TOOK A WHEEL FAILURE FOR VETTEL TO BEAT KIMI IN ALFA

LET THAT SINK IN"
"Everyone freaking out but I'm just happy there will be a new person on the podium. 

Happy days. Who in the midfield will fill the void!"
Verstappen's car took a knee.
"Ferrari getting blessed with Ver out,  RIC out, and RP engine problems. Climbing positions lol"
"Vettel being unable to race wheel to wheel exhibit #2,426"
https://www.hasvettelchoked.com/
When will Hamilton start complaining about his tires? Let's recycle all the cliches.
Did anyone test the cars for Coronavirus?
"If only it was Verstappen with softs behind the Mercs, we definitely would have great action."
Hamilton pushed him outside!
Lewis has to be penalised there
"This race is a microcosm of 2020. Just when you think everything is fine, something spins out of control."
That was 100 percent on Hamilton
"That's fucking outrageous. 5 second penalty?    


Can we backdate Max's overtake last year over Charles and give him a 5 second penalty too?"
One of the best races ever
Well it's doesn't look like those predictions of Vettel showing Leclerc the way in his final season with Ferrari are going to come true. Great drive from Leclerc to get 2nd
I’m soooo happy for Norris but man I’m bitter as hell about Albon.
"Hamilton in the MUD? 

LOVE TO SEE IT!"
Those social distancing regs just left the circuit.
HAMILTON REALLY FUCKING HATES ALBON HUH FUCKS SAKEE
Albon got fucked again by Hamilton. Last time felt like a bit of naivety from Albon but today Hamilton's arrogance and aggression was over the line
Welp there goes the race. Another Merc dominant race. So fuckin boring
Magnussen gonna focksmash a door like a fukking vänker again
Vettel is an absolute mess nowadays
Has to be a penalty.
Albon played himself there. Around the outside turn 4 is really optimistic.
Slam dunk penalty for Lewis. Albon left him so much space.
Max could’ve won this considering everything....
Fuck that. Penalize the fuck outa Hamilton.
I’ve officially lost all interest in this race. Just another Mercedes 1-2
"Well here we are, Hamilton is going to win again, so fun"
Vettel racecraft is close to 0
That wheel flying behind Kimi's car was funny at. Is this the biggest meme race ever?
Hamiltons fault I think
5 second penalty for taking a driver out... Seems very small.... Albon's whole race is ruined Hamilton gets to get a podium probably.
"Watching my 1st race, I’m excited"
"Croftys intros to a race > Another intro to a sport, dont fucking @ me cunts"
Damn it's weird not having hulkenberg on the grid.
Ferrari lawnmower Engine woooo
"wow, 100 repetitions of the race start... *sigh*"
"HAHAHA RTL cutting to ads the literal moment Hamilton makes his move

yeah I wonder why people don't want to watch that"
Hamilton’s class permanently. Guy ise brillant.
Albon kicked ass for a while there. Impressive shit
Those hard tires will last him for the rest of the race in the garage.
im going to fucking break something
My heart goes out to Max right now. That sucks.
Guess imma checkout
Stroll is doing a great job holding off Seb with an engine issue
"Lmao the two drivers I support are Ricciardo and Verstappen.

Maybe I should start supporting Hamilton, that'd stop him winning a championship."
"Mercedes honda and renault engines have issues.

Hmm"
Grosjean off? Everything back to normal.
be surprised if there are any cars left at the end
Never change Grosjean
I love seeing Hamilton hunt the leader and reduce the gap. Doesn't happen very often nowdays
Is it too early to hope for a BOT HAM crash?
Hate to say it but..  THEY'RE LOOKING LIKE A BUNCH OF FUCKING VANKERS!
Merc vs. Ferrari truly reflects mentalities of Germans and Italians
Gotta be an unsafe release penalty
"Some sweet Mercedes double entry into the box there - last time I saw something like that was on an adult website.

E: a letter"
"Ham complaining lmaoooooo, he's winning this."
Russell P12 it's happening!
George up to P12!!! Go on my son!
Wait what happened to Latifi? How is he so far behind after a safety car?
I'll be a bit happy when Seb retires because supporting this man is taking years off my life
seb doesn't give a shit anymore
Mclaren 2nd place in constructors?
"I mean I’m upset but I don’t know why everyone’s saying it’s a shit race, a lot is going on and it’s not even raining."
[removed]
"He's right, that halo graphic is sick as hell"
"If Russell gets in the points. This thread will probably shut Reddit down for a time. And I wouldn’t be mad.

Edit: well poop."
george russell is ahead of 2 drivers with a combined 5 world championships IN A WILLIAMS..
"Leclerc in a Norris and Sainz sandwich? 

😍😍😍😍😍😍"
H A M M E R T I M E
I bet they’ve not given the same message to Lewis 👀 if it was bottas chasing lewis they’d have told him to stay in position laps ago
"If the mercs crashed to each other, we have albon winning, and checo plus lando in podium. Im all for this."
God I hope Russell gets that Merc seat soon (hopefully after next year). He's having great race.
As a new viewer is every race like this? Either mercedes has problems or they run away with the 1st and 2nd place?
"""The fans want to see racing.""

*shows two Mercedes doing hotlaps for lap after lap*"
What are gearbox sensors and what do they do?
I’ve got 8€ on Bottas winning this can his engine please not blow lmao
"Watching this race, I don't even understand the purpose of 18 other cars in the grid."
"GODDAMNIT, NO. NOT RUSSELL. WHY COULDN'T YOU TAKE LATIFI INSTEAD???"
"I’d love to see Perez on the podium, I hope he’s able to hold off Albon."
"I feel like we're getting hyped up about Mercedes issues, only for them to pull a 2-3 second gap on the first lap I'd the restart."
"""Alright, send the safety car out there again, some dickhead can't work a wheel gun""

- Race control"
The tyre fell off lmao
Perez is going to get a penalty
Looking forward to Red Bull arguing about that Perez move after the race
Petition to have the two mercedes cars removed from f1. My basis is that we'll have some crazy races and multiple different winners. Can't take another year of merc 1-2. Wtf is even the point?
Surely Albon gets 3rd back
All 3 of my fantasy teams are fucked
C'mon Alex!
HEY UH vettel? POOINTS????????
"Penalty for Lewis??

Albon was ahead.."
Absolutely Hamilton’s fault
Hamilton had a ton of space on the inside. Fuck Lewis Hamilton.
albon had 10 laps to get it done! think he sniffed a win
I think some key information is that Hamilton had a consistent steering angle through the entire corner. He wasn’t moved the wheel towards Albon at all
I'm all in on Red Bull but he can't be at fault here. Was just driving his line. Unfortunately.
everybody gangsta until leclerc hunts you down.
Ferrari to get second....fuck it...take the win
Yessss penalty!!
That takes Hamilton out of the race but frees him up to be a blocker for Bottas.
Thank fuck the stewards finally do something. This needs to happen until all 20 of them learn that shoving people off is never ok.
FUCKING HELL 5 SECONDS? 5??? FOR TAKING ANOTHER DRIVER OUT OF THE FUCKING RACE. FUCK
NORRIS PODIUM PLEASE COME ON
Hamilton still gonna get 3rd hahahahhaa. How awful.
LANDOOOO PODIUMMMMMMMMM FUCKK YEAHHHHHH
Zak never walked so fast in his life
This looks really bad for Vettel.
Albon should be up there
Are they playing in fake crowd sounds?
Bottas 3.0. Ferrari were sandbagging. McLaren WCC champions
WHAT AN INSANE RACE
Wow what a race
Same track layout next week? Or reversed?
/r/formula1 in the future: Albon outscored Max in 2020 and is therefore the better driver
"That was bad news for Bottas. Now there’s no one between him and Hamilton, so count on the team to fuck him over."
"Well now, Hamilton couldn't be bothered to reach and overtake Max so he just wiggled a finger and the thing happened."
Lmao Renault is laughing so hard rn
Glad we’re back to normal: a completely forgettable race dominated by Mercedes.
Latifi isn’t impressing me
Lowkey hoping the two Mercs wreck each other when they meet.
"_Ham not 1st_

_Ham complaining_

F1 is really back :')"
Safety cars last way too long. HURRY UP
Hamilton played dirty
Lewis I don't like albon Hamilton
"What is Brundle tallking about? That move from Albon was perfect, 100% Hamilton's fault again - worse than Brazil if anything."
"What is Brundle on about? That was a textbook overtake, clean as fuck. Albon was ahead and Hamilton went wide."
Nice to see Lewis is following in Schumacher's footsteps by punting people off the track ;)
If Leclerc can podium this car then I'm fully on board with believing that he's a future World Champion
Yo I just fucking NUTTED
"5 seconds? He's fucked Albon out of the points completely, damaged his car, and he get 5 seconds? Should
 be a drive through penalty at least.

All he does is turn up the engine and get a 5 second gap now."
Is that piped in crowd noise? really? lol
"What a fucking child... ""he's doing more kerbs than me!!!"""
This race needs a Mercedes DNF
"Nobody:


Not a single F1 fan:


Mercedes: 1-2"
"Disappointing for Albon but that has to be a racing incident. 


That said I would be surprised if Albon didn't start disliking Hamilton."
The best national anthem tbh
ITS HERE ITS HERE ITS HERE
Go Lando!
FINALLY!!!
First race thread of the year. let's goy boys
Genuinely lovely performance of the Austrian anthem there.
Hope you all have a great race!
It's been a long fucking time.
Austrian B-25????
"No spectators in the standings sucks, but at least we've got a race."
F1 IS BACK
Happy race day from the steamy midwest USA! Let's GO!
Williams 1-2. Let's go.
"Well, things have now changed with Hamilton's penalty. Bottas may open up a gap with the rest if he starts well"
"""look guys, I know the 'Rona is still on the loose, but we can't have Hamilton on our tabloid cover with a mask on!"""
"Carbon neutral f1 seems ambitious, I'm all for it"
have fun watching the race everybody ♥️
Best of luck to everyone. Hope we can all enjoy this sport being back after all this time. Racing is why we are all here together.
Here’s to the first race of the year!
"I don't remember the last time I was so excited for an F1 race. I think this year could be a very good one, this race too."
Toto thicc
"Say what you want F1 fans

but it’s fucking race time and nobody can stop us"
Lando hype
"Good morning from the US. Was treated to some great races courtesy of IndyCar, NASCAR, and IMSA yesterday. And now if that wasn't enough, F1 has finally returned.

Looking forward to seeing today's action in Austria!"
Remember David spinning Mika around in corner 2?
"Pretty excited to see how terrible the Ferrari race pace is, we've managed to build an impressively shitty car."
I'm curious if the rust factor will impact the start
Feels great to be back. Hyped for Lando starting P3
"These are my favorite moments of the weekend. Before the music and the talking, just the teams getting ready and the sounds of the racetrack."
I am so indescribably excited now
Glad to see F1 back!
motorsportsstreams doesnt work and im clueless as how to watch it?
Wonder if Hamilton ignored the yellow on purpose because he knew his first lap was going to get deleted? Would be starting P13 now if he had given up on the second lap completely.
""
F1 TV has shit the bed - can not connect keep getting error messages
Did ESPN just say they're carrying an Eagles concert tonight at 8 p.m.? To what end?
Were back baby!!!
HYPEEEE MUSICCCCX WE BACCKKK
*insert hype music*
Love paying for F1TV to have to watch the race through cable and watch ads.
[deleted]
ESPN viewers having to YouTube the hype music
Hype music incoming!
Thanks ESPN ;-;
"ESPN misses the hype music on the 1st race


Nothing has changed"
"Ah, how I missed being 30 seconds to a minute behind on the stream and balancing between joining the conversation and preventing seeing spoilers.

Here is to a great race!"
FINALLY!!!! LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!
"For anyone whose F1TV is down, you can watch via a free 14-day Youtube TV trial!"
Let’s go lads
Fuckin goosebumps hearing the opening
"GOD I MISS THE INTRO SO MUCH

THE INTENSITY OF PRE RACE

AAAAAAAAAA

WE ARE BAAAAACK"
"All the 70th anniversary stuff really got buried by everything, didn't it?"
Is... is Haas not in the intro?
Cmon Crofty I’ve missed your bullshit. God it feels great to have f1 back.
My goodness Crofty is such a great commentator. His buildups and openings are incredible.
"What issue is everyone having? For me it seems super tough to get to a page that lets you load the stream, but once it’s started it’s good. 

I’m guessing they farmed out the stream to someone reliable, but the backend is run by someone’s home server in Tibet."
"""We race together"" reminds me of

""All for one .... And every man for himself"" - Blackadder"
God I missed this
"Sheesh, the fuck is going on with f1tv. I might need to find a stream"
Why is Hamilton starting 5th?
HYPED LANDO P3
I'm ready to be disappointed by the Ferrari
Ahhhh the hills are alive with the sounds of *horsepower*
Where has the faster music gone during the starting grid presentation? That was my favorite bit of the music :(
Why did they push Max back a bit?
"Guys imagine,  
  
All the Mercs crash themselves out, Lando thunders out to a 10s lead until Lap 71. Comes around lap 71. Pagenaud suddenly appears and TBones him.  
  
Merc 1-2"
Weird to see the current champion starting from P17.
LANDOOOOO
Start work in 8 hours but boys I'm here. i think if Lando wins I'll nut on my desk in the morning
Why am I paying a shktload of money for f1tv if theyre unable to provide their most wanted service in form of a live stream?
"may not be the best place to ask, but is anyone else having issues on the F1 TV website? Feeling a bit frustrated that I've finally subscribed just to have half the season cancelled and now the stream isn't even loading for me when we finally get a race"
It is bloody great to be back.
F1TV wth?!!!!!!!!!!!!
"God, the nature around Spielberg is just gorgeous"
Lando and Dan let’s go
"Fukcing f1 tv 
Did race start?"
ITS LIGHTS OUT AND AWAY WE GO
Light out and away we go!
"F1TV, nice move. Just missed the start in over 200 days."
Fucking hell Bottas is gone.
Does Bottas already have DRS or something? Fuck he pulled away easily.
Great defending from albon
That was a relatively clean start. Wasn’t expecting that
More smoke on Perez
Perez says no
Holy hell Bottas
god i missed this.
"If Albon did that at Corkscrew a la Rossi & Zanardi, I can't wait to hear Hamilton complaining."
#THREE WIDE
Bye Bottas
Does perez’ engine keep smoking every now and then?
Incredible race win from Bottas
Only a 2.3s gap after 1 lap...
Bottas what a gap what a start!
Perez looks like he’s smoking a bit...
"So, unless something unexpected happens, Bottas has already won this race."
Russell :((
racing point Vaping like hell
Bottas has checked out
2.4s clear already wow
This is gonna be a cakewalk for Bottas.
"HOUSTON, WE HAVE SAINZ ON CAMERA"
this is 2014 all over again. mercedes are so far ahead
season is so over lol
2.5 seconds ahead! Mercedes go BRRRRRRR!
Bottas is already fucking gone. What the hell Mercedes.
"lol, Bottas gonna lap the whole field in 5 laps."
Bottas: Adios
Lando is one hell of an addition to the front of the pack
"Bottas look after your car, overheating already?"
Bottas is already into next year
Racing Point with that OG bam bam Ferrari mentality engine.
bottas is gone is an understatement
Sainz must be conflicted about how hard to fight Leclerc.
"Radio: Important, look after the car

Bottas 3.0: minimal talking"
"They’re showing Sainz, what?"
"Merc telling their drivers to slow up and pace themselves on lap 2, love it."
MOTOGP VIBES WITH ALL THIS OVERTAKING
"GO, GO, GOOOOO!!.."
Bottas looking like Usain Bolt
Bottas has checked out at the front. That’s a huge gap already.
"*looks at flair*

*looks at tv*

This could finally be it boys"
They showed Sainz!
It’s hard to tell the Alfa/alpha/haas apart when they are running together in the sun
"I'm so excited to see Albon up there with Max, really awesome"
"Max ""Huh, maybe the outside line would've been better after all"""
Lets go Max and Albon!
Fuck me. Bottas pulled a 2.4 second lead in two laps...
Verstappen already coming closer to Bottas!
Jesus Ferrari
The softs are already slower ffs
F Norris
Anyone else having trouble with F1 Tv?
Albon low key having a great start and keeping Lewis at bay. Impressive.
Let’s see if Pink Merc >> McL
Force India ripping fat farts
Hmmmm Ocon
Bottas go meep meep
Claire Williams: where’s the blue shell?
Rooting for Alex now! Podium boyyyy
Williams straight to rock bottom... lol
I can't get used to how different the Ferrari sounds
C’MON ALEX!!!!!!!
It feels so weird not seeing Ferrari carve their way into the top 6 after just a few laps.
HERE'S LEWIS
"Albon vs Hamilton for 3rd, now where have we seen this before"
The gap of performance between Merc and the others is insane lol
Honda sounds so good
"""I'm full of oil."" 

-Both Ferraris probably"
Well this is definitely a race between the two Merc boys
Albon fighting hard
"The field still seems to be staying relatively compressed, the race paces are much more homogenous this year. Hopefully that means some really good racing throughout the year"
Mercedes setting fastest laps one after the other.. 😪
Ferrari pRoMoTiOn to F1.5 confirmed
That turn 1 replay was amazing
Ham smoking??
Lewis looks menacing chasing after Albon in that all black livery
Dafuq Merc is smoky
Oof at this rate Williams F1 team won't make it to 2021.
After all that excitement the only real change is the fight for the podiums is now even less competitive lmao
"Mercedes - Red Bull - Mercedes - Red Bull.

Sounds like ballroom dancing."
"Did anyone see LeClerc's onboard? Wow. The engine sounds like it has no power at all, especially compared to an onboard from last year."
Those Mercedes must have SO much more power it's almost unfair.
The way this Hamilton-Albon battle shook out makes me think the Mercedes can’t follow closely for very long because of the heat. Hamilton obviously had the faster car but he was backing off pretty quickly when he didn’t make a move stick.
VER VS HAM here we GO!
No cutting to the crowd half way through an overtake is a breath of fresh air
Oh dear. Another Mercedes year unless their cars blow up
"Yikes, Haas is continuing their form from last year :("
"Man what a shame, this year is gonna boring as shit"
"Ferraris getting smoked by the clearly superior Racing Points, what a world"
Damn that’s almost too easy
"Verstappen consistently down on straight-line speed. Think he's got much more to come from the Honda

Currently he's 15kph down on Albon in first speed trap"
Perez dropped Leclerc like a bad ex.
Still believe they should have gone for hulk
"After F5ing F1TV's site for the last ten laps, I finally got in"
Oh shit max is gone
NOOOOOH
Well this is gonna be a really exciting season..
Merc way too fast. Ridiculous.
Uh oh Honda-san
Oh wow shame.
this year it'll be Merc rbr with 3rd a fight between the midfields
Welp... R.I.P. to any chance of their being any undercut strat...
Race over
Fuuuuuuuuuuuck Max
"gp2 engine, gp2"
Back to iRacing
Verstoppen
ffs
VERSTAPPEN MECHANICAL FAILURE?!
nice mercedes 1 and 2... closing my stream
Well that didn't take long
Vettel overtook Verstappen.
Red Bull and electrical isssues
Loooool
Red bull having an F1 TV moment.
RIP the 3peat for Max :/
"Verstappen: ""oh shit, here we go again"""
Anyone else having a massive issue with f1 tv not working?
Did they put a Renault in Max's car by mistake?
MAX NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Vtech gone.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO VER :((((((((((((
Feel so bad for Max goddamn
#DRAMA
"mercedes 1,2 it is"
Nooooooo
Back to Mercedes 1-2.
"Do you also feel that the public is missing?  I’m really missing some background noise, it feels really bland."
Verstappening: boy I sure am having a good race I hope my phone doesn't ring any time soon
Wasn't long before we got a shot of Horner & Co looking a bit miffed on the pitwall
Clearly having no dutch fans there has cursed his car
Try turning it off and on? :(
VTech kicked in so hard antistall just woke up
So. Evidently my stream is like 2 laps behind based on when everyone realised what happened. Thanks F1TV for being a mess
Looks like max went a lap head banging to some crazy heavy metal.
Well there goes an interesting race.....
"Albon, Norris or Perez podium?"
Now its Going to get boring
That stalling RB sounds pretty good tbf.
Lmao this is insane
Team radio sounds like he’s on hold with tech supports
Albon WDC
CTRL + ALT  + DELETE
Interesting that we're having the issue of the car breaking during the race because of driver input. We've never had this before.
"Am a very casual F1 fan, why does this happen to Verstappen half the time I watch a race?"
so is that on the engine or on the steering wheel program???
I just hope that Alex can maintain his podium position 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK. The only outside chance at there not being a Mercedes 1-2 just shot itself in the head.
Nooo fuck!
Albon podium party
Is this part of the long game strategy?
"Well, that's all folks."
Damn the shot of the Dutch grandstands with Max’s broken car...
ctrl+alt+delete
VER F§$$% counter: 2
Fuck this shit.
"Fucking cursed it is,another merc 1-2."
RESTART THE SEASON
"> maybe they can do a ctrl-alt-delete or something

lord"
"Oh man, he was doing so well. He clearly had the pace to challenge Bottas, giving his tire advantage."
"Just wtf is wrong with rtl, just going to ad break when Lewis attempts to overtake albon 😡. Had to see max going out in rewind"
You guys wanted Albon to get a podium
"Mercedes look set to get first, second and third this race."
FUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
Martin the tech support guru there
Max is gonna throw hands
Alex for podium!!
Fade me
This is just heart breaking.... No Verstappen....
RIP Verstappen
All that shithousing with the Stewards and we still get a Merc 1-2
Williams outperforming Verstappen. Shock of the season.
Sigh. Fuck.
Verstappen out already this sucks 😩
I don't like Max but he would have been the one to spice this race up.
When i own a boat im gonna call it: The Furious Young Dutchman.
I think this is the first time I have seen someone bump start an F1 car
"Ricciardo on Vettel
This should be fun"
let's go albon!!!! I wanted him to get a podium ever since brazil and this is the perfect time now.
I'd be dead interested to know what actually happened with Max's car
Is it weird that I actually missed Crofty?
Don't think changing the tires will do anything
whenever you have hope for something other than mercedes 1-2 it gets stomped on
Vettel battling Lance fcking Stroll ... well done Ferrari
Race is over lads
F maaax :'(
Did his gear changer get stuck or what?
Ferrari battling with last year's mercedes. Nice
"Hey everybody thanks for coming out tonight, we're the Furious Young Dutchmen, let's open up that pit ONETWOTHREEFOUR"
F
Welcome back to 2014 everyone!
Uh that Ferrari is so bad
Vettel cant overtake. There is just no straight line speed
LECLERC TAKE MY ENERGY
Can Lewis take 7 seconds out of Bottas is the question...
Mercedes 1-2: I am inevitable
WILLIAMS NOT LAST
2020 strikes again
What did Max mean referring to the settings being changed?
"Please just keep the camera on the midfield, grazie"
Latifi not P20 at least :)
The Ferrari just cant come close enough on the straights.
Well max has won something at least. It’s the first retirement of the season but still.
Aside from a McLaren/Racing Point miracle the only interesting thing in this race will be Lewis doing a Hammer time and taking the fight to Bottas. I feel bad for not having more faith in Albon
The same person who programmed F1TV is the same person who coded the Red Bull Programming this race
"“Mercedes 1-2” 
DREAD IT RUN FROM IT DESTINY STILL ARRIVES"
Ferrari race pace not looking too bad.
Stroll engine problem?
"Riccardo late braking dive bomb, come on I can feel it"
"Merc 1-2, Williams at the bottom. Different year, same shit"
"Lmao Stroll has engine issues but the Ferrari can't keep up with it. 

It's a rucking Fiat lads."
"Everyone has brought up how bad the Williams are again, but don't ignore Grosjean down there stinkin' things up too."
Perez dropping off a lot
At least Albon or Norris could get their first podium
Everyone will fall apart except for Merc
^God  ^damnit.
"""There is no pace to the Ferrari at all, completely without any chance here"" - Swedish commentator"
"Verstappen retired, So F1TV is working again!"
Ferrari can't beat a broken RP. Haha...
Hopefully Alex manages to still get a podium for Red Bull
mclarens on the right pace thank god
"I was initially worried that McLaren had no race pace, but I'm starting to think that the entire midfield is so close in pace that nobody can pull away from or pass anyone else."
Ferrari can’t even pass Stroll with an engine problem
Ferrari on a straight too slow to overtake a Racing point with engine issues.
More engine problems? Looking like the F2 race earlier lmao
RENAULT ARE BACK
Not Danny Ric
ENGINE ISSUES EVERYWHERE.
Well Ricciardo is retiring to join Max
At this point I just want the season to end quickly.
Max & Danny are just cursed
and now Dani Ric!? Nooooo
"I didn't watch the 2019 season because there was no reason to. Seems there's not much point  watching this season either. Jenson was right on Friday, F1 would be much more entertaining if Mercedes wasn't around."
Verstappen deserved better
It eezz what it eezz
Danny ric is out for sure
FFS................. 2021 CANT COME FAST ENOUGH
Real flashback here with Max and Danny DNFs
I can't wait for Danny ric to join mclaren...
Hamilton's gap to Albon just keeps increasing. This is crazy.
"This year instead of racing Kubica, Russell is racing alone."
"Wow, third mechanical problem in 18 laps."
"Mercedes: power& grip.
RB: no power but grip.
Ferrari: no power no grip.
Williams: no idea."
FFS!!!!
"Fuck this engine formula so much. Mercedes has been the best power unit for at least five of the last seven years, and cars can't even pass a Merc PU when they're having problems."
AH FFS RENAULT
"how bad can this race get, oh come on!"
"And you get engine issues, and you get engine issues & everyone gets engine issues except Mercedes"
How many engines y’all think will shit the bed today?
Oh my goodness. This is rough.
Just 8 more retirements and it’s points for Williams.
Well I’d rather have racing with sad retirements than none at all
Fucking hell give Ricciardo a break
Noooo Danny
Heres hoping Albon can finish 3th!
LETS GO VETTEL!
[deleted]
"Cannot BELIEVE Ferrari this year, this is low, even for them. If someone told me they'd be racing Force India 2 years ago, I woulda laughed hard"
Time for a engine blowing competition.
Guess Danny and Max get to hang out again.
Just fade me fam
I'm getting 2017 PTSD.
"Well this has been incredibly disappointing, don't know why I expected anything else :("
RIC and VER dnf homies
At this pace Haas could get some points!
"Fuck This.

I'll just come back in 2021."
Danny boi just wants to give his friend Max a company.
"Max, Danny, and soon Lance. Holy hell"
3 cars with power problems! What is happening
"Stay positive folks! At this rate, Russell might score his first points!"
"Ferrari looking good, could be a double points finish."
F in the chat for gearboxes
Lets just hope Merc fucks up and we get Albon Norris Perez podium
Ugh why do I even bother
"RENAULT IS AN ABSOLUTE SHIT BOX. Enjoy it, Cyril."
Big fucking oofs for this race but for real I’m just happy to have it back
So much for Danny Ric finishing in front of Ferrari. Fucking Renault
“Yay 2020” - D. Ricciardo 3
Fuck black cars and no overheating lol
engine going social distancing
So what we've concluded already is that Mercedes have the least dodgy power unit.
And you lot mugged me off when I massively overpaid for Albon on fantasy F1
Might as well rename it Formula Mercedes.
"Jesus, albon a second off mercedes per lap"
"The hills are alive, with the sound of sad engines..."
Appears like RP also copied Mercedes issues at Austria from last year
Looks like f1tv is live now
This race is the perfect metaphor for 2020 lmaooo
stroll looks like he lost hybrid power
[deleted]
Engine go poof
How does RIC break his car so often? Is it his driving style because be seems to break down an awful lot.
I expect Lewis to catch bottas
F1 Tv working y'all
Well Haas might get a point now
Ferrari engine must have caught COVID too
Stroll falling down the order now
"Woohoo thank you Renault and Racing Point now we can finally be sure to get a few points from both cars

Unless.."
Ricciardo and Verstappen with power unit problems... Its 2018 all over again :-(
Ham will win this
Shame Stroll is dropping so badly.
"GUYS ALBON, MIGHT GET A PODIUM."
"F1 is back better than ever!

Engines- Hold my cylinders."
Two gearbox failures already. Did they not try to improve these over the last 7 months?
"According to F1TV, Albon lost his tracker on the outside of 5"
Williams is gonna win this by being the last car standing.
I think the pink mercs have the same overheating problems as last year. Isn’t that a surprise...
I hate these shows that kill off fan favourites in the season premiere just for shock value.
Ferrari shitting the bed is really not good for the sport.
Only thing left is making fun of Ferrari. Pls don't disappoint.
WILLIAMS NOT LAST ON TRACK
Albon is losing a tenth every two seconds. But Norris is not gaining on him. Mercedes is absolutely flying now.
"No way Stroll makes it to the end of the race, engine has shat the bed"
"Death 

Taxes

Mercedes 1-2"
Strolls engine overheating? Would be one of the known gremlins of last years mercedes
Grosjean trying to ruin the Haas budget again
RUS P16!
"I'm sure Romain  ""scheduled"" that run through the gravel, Crofty."
Does f1tv give refunds?
Did we wait all this time to see this?
Good to see Grosjean is still the same after Covid
Fuck it I'll take KMag points then
And a Stroll retirement. Was having engine issues.
"Grosjean is a waste of a seat. 18th, dead last, versus KMAG in 11th almost into points"
damn we cant even have A f1 race in 2020
Maybe it's time Haas think about a new driver.....
Grosjean had an off....we are well and truly back
Monaco 1996 will be born again.
Ocon doesn't seem to have the pace yet
Imagine 30 minutes ago thinking that the Ferrari PU was the safest haha.
I seriously don't know why HAAS kept RoGro when Hulk doesn't have a drive.
Grosjean just can't help himself.
 Death taxes and Romain Grosjean
80s reliability in 2020
"At first I thought Grosjean just went wide like Bottas but no, he actually spun"
"No Ferrari engine blown yet. They may not have the power. But do they have the relaiability? Unlikely, but we'll see"
Ferrari trying to copy Mercs fake pit moves now?
What a play by Ferrari box lol
"Good news for Haas, it's not Australia so they shouldn't fuck up the pit stop at least!"
Charles' engineer sounded like the most stressed man I've ever heard.
"Undercutting Perez, things you love to see"
Some old-school unreliability in the first race!
"Ferrari, you're fighting nobody significant and you're still doing dummy pitstops."
Ferrari doing a Mercedes?
Uh oh Merc in trouble?
Ferrai demonstrating their strategy is top notch once again
attrition war? Looks like we're on for an attrition war
The Haas looks so much like the Alfa!
"x1 RP and x1 Renault retirement. Edit: And a Bull.

Bet Mclaren loving this right now!"
I'm not sure who I want to see on the podium more. Alex or lando.
Ocon struggling to get past a Haas. Not great
"Hamilton is catching Bottas, lap by lap."
I was so excited for a great race. But it's Mercedes 1-2 again. Don't the fans of Mercedes even get bored with that?
"Both Lewis and Valtteri have been told to look after the cars then, this isn't over"
Although everyone would complain because it’s lucky for Lewis an SC would be good so the Mercs battle
Lewis is COMIN. Taken 2 seconds off already
"If you told me six months ago that Ferrari would be playing the attrition game to fight their way up the pack, I would have called you crazy. 

I, for one, cannot wait to see Mr. Steiner's totally calm response to Romain's little spin."
"Wait, Hard tyres appearing ice blue on the graphics now ?"
Ferrari is the only manufacturer not to have a retirement at this point
RIC and VER are doing the shoey rn
Ugh the Hamilton and Albon gap
Watch out guys Ferrari strategists at it again
Lewis is absolutely flying out there.
Embarrassing by Bottas.
Lewis's pace is immense.
The pace difference between Hamilton and bottas is crazy
"""The two white lines that represent the race track""

Okay now he's just doing it on purpose"
wondering if the 18 inch tires would make those curbs less sever
HAM one sec faster than Bottas
3.8s!!??
Is Lewis on another planet right now or what
Hamilton is closing incredibly fast and this is one of the easier tracks to pass on. Unless Bottas finds some speed I can’t see him winning this.
"> What he's saying there is to stay off those curbs

this just in: racing on the track > racing off the track"
That Renault is so loud wtf
(H) tyres now have a blue symbol?
Bottas just lost another 4 tenths in the middle sector even to Albon
Lol Magnussen
MAG puncture?
At least the Haas boys are still the same
Mags is out
"You're meant to hit the brakes there, KMag."
WOW!
this race is a MESS
That Renault engine sounds dreadful tbh
"Every year is the same with Bottas, people hype him as the champion but Hamilton will pass him in 5 laps and it will be over"
Safety car!
And that's magnussen
You HAAS to be kidding me
Helicopter cock blocking its own shit
What the hell Mag
K-Mag wtf
"Haas on form. Grosjean spins, other one has brake failure"
hard tyre icon is...  blue?
YEET
Jesus this Renault engine is killing my ear
That renault engine screech it doesnt sound healthy
SAFETY CAR WOOHOO
[deleted]
Safety car
Haha want the fuck Magnussen
Haased out
Yes!! We have safety car!!
Super gutted for Max :(
"Jesus, they could use Renault's engine sound in scary movies"
"SC, that’s great for Hamilton."
The fuck? Ocon didn’t even touch him...
"Safety Car, exactly what we needed! Norris to the podium!"
"OHHHH SHIT MAGNUSSEN

GO RUSSELL, JUST DONT PIT AND PRESS THE GAS PEDAL TO P10!"
How can Haas still have brake issues after all these years
Potential here for the first British 123 since 68?
We need a madness from Alex at the safety car restart
"At this point, Williams could get points just by finishing"
So who's all lapped rn?
What an entertaining first Grand Prix lol... its been fucking crazy.
Did he lose breaks? That looked really weird.
Was Ocon's onboard sound really harsh for anyone else? Sounded like I was directly behind a jet engine
Congratulations Lewis 🎉
That Renault sounds horrendous.
Free pit stops for all immediately after Kimi pitted
that could end badly holy shit
"This race is on the shitter. Max out, Ric out, Mercedes 15 seconds seconds ahead. The least I can hope is for an Alex podium."
That double stack tho
Watching this race [like](https://youtu.be/FSswEzWJdWo)
Welp that just fucked Seb's race
That’s an unsafe release for Perez.
What happened to Raikonnen? He's behind Latifi now?
Williams point finish?!?!?!
Williams are going to wind up with points at the rate of these retirements...
Unsafe release as fuck
fvck they ruined landos pit
Pen for Perez. Definitely unsafe release.
Penalty for Perez surely?
Merc getting a free pit stop is exactly what this race needed.
Safety car for that?
Unsafe release holy hell
"2.8, 2.5. Nice."
Perfection from Mercedes
Is this ARCA?
fucking hell the merc double stack
"Please don't rush marshals, let everyone stack up!"
"The safety car could help Bottas, give him a bit of time to breathe"
"""Two seconds Ted""   - - Triple drink . ."
Perez on mediums? Interesting strategy choice
Perez is gonna lose some seconds here
Ferrari strategy 10/10 so far in 2020
Haas? More like Haasnt amarite
Oh fucking hell I hope Perez doesnt get a penalty for that
Great double stop. Perfectly executed.
Did they finally figure out something with the onboards where the engines finally sound different?
Nice
At least Perez was more smart than the pit crew who released him too early
That double stack was beautiful. Also Sergio don’t care.
Russell might end up in the points in with how quick they’re dropping.
Bad luck Lando
Mercedes just flexed so hard
Awful release that.
"Perez to the medium, interesting choice"
UNSAFE RELEASE
If Perez was Twitch prime'd to Lando he'd know that he was never winning that battle because Lando is still on his PC in his head.
Williams left russell on track???? Why???
Praying for no penalty now for Perez
Why did perez go on mediums
"Perez on med's, interesting. Could be thinking about another stop? There's no way they can last the entire race"
"Lewis and Bottas is about to battle, should spice this up"
"Perez better make hay while the sun shines, his tyres are gonna be dead at the end"
What's the Safety Car for? Magnussen?
Can Perez genuinely finish the race on Mediums?
You can even see the Haas brake exploding!
Brake issues for Kevin?
I think Mclaren also double stacked. Hopefully theres footage
Cmon russel
If there's someone that can make those mediums last is Perez
"The first race of the season and disappointing already....2020 is cursed indeed

Edit: Vettel spinning while fighting sainz made my day...can't wait for memes

Kimi with no tyre

Merc with gearbox issue 

Leclerc fighting gasley

Albon experiencing Brazil 2019

Lando p3...*\0/*

Leclerc p2 

Kyvat has tyre issue

Latifi P11 WTF

Wtf is this race

Yep this race has been entertaining but not the race I hoped for"
Now we get to compare both merc drivers raw pace.
Flying start NASCAR style
Russell almost in the points
Wtf? My streeam seems to be having seizures. I can't believe I'm paying yo struggle to watch a race
Why weave when they've got DAS?
Inb4 Hamilton complains that the safety car is too slow.
Safety car sounds gooooood.
This is das
"What do they mean by ""Lapped Cars""? Cars that completed there lap before the yellow?"
That front right type on Bottas's car looks like it has a bit of damage from the onboard view
Why is the safety car still here
"What's up with Bottas's right tire, it's already in bad shape !"
Did I see blisters on Bottas' front tires?
Come on Albon..
Thanks Kevin. Now we have a race to watch.
41 laps with no pit stops.
"Bottas and Hamilton crash, Albon wins!"
DAS puns were good for like 5 minutes
I wish they showed Kimi driving in a straight line and not being bothered like others to keep the tyres warm.
Russell is going to be in the points if more engines give up.
Those pink arrows are bullying those ferraris...
Perez on mediums someone please tell me this is gonna work out lol
Cyril sabotages Ric's car.
Nice restart by Bottas
That has to be a penalty for RP
WTF Vettel?
Not again.....
And there it is!
Not a phenomenal restart for valtteri
Classic Vettel
Oof Vettel
"Fuck

This

Shit"
VETTEL SBIN
LMAO Vettel can't catch a break
my god what an amazing shitshow this is!
Sbin
oh no seb
Seb Spinnala count: 1
And there he goes... Vettel ends up facing the other way.
Runnnn bottassss
Bingo
Holy shit you can’t make this up for ferrari
Vettel spinning we are truly back
IT HAPPENED
I saw that coming from a mile away
Sbinala?
Fucking hell Vettel
"Vettel spins, it's just like last year"
 Oh no not again
"Cheering hard for Russell to beat cars from two other teams, would be wonderful to see Williams getting back into it."
Poor judgment Seb.
NotLikeThisNotLikeThisNotLikethis
that's on seb
"Seb was never gonna squeeze on the inside there.

Had to be him though...."
NOW the season has begun.
I’ve seen it all lol
FFS Seb
GRAZZIE REGAZZIIIIIIII
OF FUCKING COURSE
Classic Vettel tbh
SBIN
Vettel what was that???
Ferrari memes.
GRAZIE RAGAZZI!
"""I was very surprised Ferrari didn't want me for next season"" - Vettel"
The meme Vettel career at Ferrari has been is quite honestly golden.
That gap was never on. What was Vettel thinking.
I'm here for the spinning jokes
Man this race is like all the F1 clichés from the past 5 years put together.
Oh no seb what is you doin
Seb spins ! 2019 continues
And it keeps going down hill for Ferrari
 drink 1
Mamma mia!
Vettel mistake
Vettel driving like a rookie.
"Vettel, Vetteling"
You GOT to be FUCKING KIDDING ME
"I joked about Williams getting points due to other failures, but it looks like Russell might actually do it."
VETLEL
PEAK F1
So fucking stupid.
Vettel should trademark these spins
................... i think thats on vettel smh
seb???
"Hahahahaha fuck I’m switching off, worst race and the season just started. I’m glad it’s a short season"
Lololololololol
My God
Crofty rushing Ted giving us info about the mechanical failure just so he can rattle off some temps.
That does just sum it up doesn't it?
What is seb even thinking getting involved in that chaos
"Death, taxes and Vettel making a mistake and spinning"
""
MEME👏RACE👏
Mein gotte muss das seine!
Say the words Bart...
You spin me right round.
And that is why you don't have a contract next year Vettel.
"Seb has taken a spin.

F1 is back indeed!"
Symbolic as fuck that
Absolute ping pong there Seb
Episode IV: ALBON - the last HOPE
plan sBin
Omg Seb.... Yikes
"Hey! I’ve seen that one, it’s a classic!"
"Alex, Lando, and Checo need to have the races of their lives at the moment"
"Vettel, man, what were you doing?"
Classic Vettel
Ferrari in shambles
What a crazy race!
"I absolutely love Seb, but that was his fault. Hope he finds a home next year where he can thrive again."
"Ah Mclaren vs Ferrari, like the good old days"
"They've made the ""right decision"" after one race, Crofty? Really?"
F1 is officially back with the Vettel spin. Classic
rip vettle
This race feels like I'm watching the highlights of last season
Russell in 12th. Scenes.
This race is destroying my poor heart already
Damn Checo
"P3 or P8, the Vettel spin is inevitable"
How did Russell get far up the order
Racing Point is on point today!
But that's much safer if Vettel and Charles stay as far as possible from each other
I mean i would be frustrated aswell if i had to drive that shitbox.
Perez P4 come on get that Red Bull. Mercedes 1-2-3!
I want Albon and Norris on the same podium!
wtf how does Vettel ALWAYS spin??
Sbinatta!
Kimi up to 13th! He's doing much better in the race! :D
Russell for 10th place plzzzzzz
Russell in P12 holding his own.  At this rate there might be a good chance for some points.
Are they going to do something about that Racing Point? It's so unfair
Come on Perez!
"The Ferrari is so fucking slow, the only legit overtake was Vet on Ric at the start, every other place they've gained is from retirements"
"Vettel's beautiful ballet pirouet, Danny Ric DNF, Red Bull engine failure, Merc 1-2, yeeee F1 is back bois"
4 seconds gap to Albon already is crazy.
Coffin dance for Bottas playing right now
Holy crap thats a shit mic
The way things are going I woudn't be that surprised if Williams got a point. Russell's lap times seem to be pretty similar to the cars directly ahead
Leclerc’s onboard mic sounds like shit
Can’t help but think that perez on mediums will come back to bite him
Russell beating 3 Ferraris at the moment guys!
Russell two seconds from points. Please racing Gods
Williams Point Party
You can’t make this shit up this year
This race is wild.
I'm really annoyed that Alex's big gap behind was destroyed by the safety car.
Perez is a beast
My man Russel is killing it out there...
MERCEDES AHAHAHA
God I’ve missed this dearly
Merc 1-2 can get tiring but those cars are just incredible to watch
Sainz getting a downgrade going to Ferrari.
"Is bottas going backwards, Hamilton God mode"
"Mercedes modes war incoming, inspired by N.Rosberg"
"huh, lewis SAID GIMME POWER!!!!!!!!!!"
Lol Grosjean
"Strawberry laces are way better than sherbet lemons thought

Don't @ me"
"Hamilton’s grid penalty was just prolonging the inevitable race win. Merc is fast, like really fast."
Team orders already?
Even 2020 couldn't stop Mercedes domination
Wonder if HAM will go HAM at Bottas now
"Like, Mercedes doesn't need to do anything but build a car that stays reliable...

How do people expect competition they they can't even build a car that can race without issues"
Let's get this checo cmon
That rear view in the halo is nice
"George P12, nice"
I kind of dig the rear view camera view!
When Ham is in the lead they will call it off.
LEWIS FASTEST LAPPPPPPP
What can't Mercedes call off?
Oh I love that graphic
Valtteri has no pace on these hards it seems
Feela like the one time they should actually be showing the lead ffs
"As an aside from this race, there is a special place in hell for the bell end that allowed players to have two weapons in Mario Kart"
The mic on Leclerc onboard is shit.
Battle for the lead and we're seeing a midfield car fighting noone...
"Formula 1: Mercedes

Formula 1.25: Red Bull

Formula 1.5: McLaren, Ferrari, Racing Point

Formula 1.75: AlphaTauri, Renault, Alfa Romeo, Haas, Half of Williams

Formula 1.99: the other half of Williams"
What’s RUS’s time behind GIO? Is he in DRS or am I mistaken?
Rear view mirror?!? That’s hot
"LOL I never looked down at the Halo graphic until Crofty pointed it out

Eyes always forward"
"McLaren vs Ferrari, oh how I've missed seeing that"
Perez told rears will be the limit on this stint.
Anyone else's sound out of sync on f1tv?
Grosjean shouldn't even be in F1 considering his performance last season.
It'll be game over for Grosjean's Instagram comments if he gets black flagged for track limits 💀
How is Williams so slow with the Merc engine.
Latifi what are you doing bro
Mercedes need to give Russell the “Grosjean Special” engine mode.
That renault has some mad turbo whistle
So the Mercs are +5 ahead of everyone... Jeezsus
Albon first podium let's go
Sainz dropping back to save tyres
Perez and albon matching times
Sainz is actually getting camera play guys
5 tenths between the 2 mercs and the race director is showing some random midfielder cruising around WTF
Cmon Lando!
 Why is it that the Renault engine sounds like a PS4?
"""not exactly on the ragged edge is he?""

gets fastest lap."
Bottas chassis problems?
Really hope Perez's tyres fall off.  Might've been the strategy move of the race because Lando was keeping him consistently back prior to the safety car and now Perez has built a gap.
Multi 21 by Merc
Merc reliability issues please. PLEASE!
Tbf Norris was destined for 5th in Belgium until his car bwoke
"I am wondering, how loud are the cars this year?"
"Sing with me..

BOTTAS BOTTAS

BOTTAA BOTTAS"
Lewis has to be close enough thru t1
Was that an automated error code read out by a Mercedes bot onboard bottas car ?
That’s the most robotic radio call I’ve ever heard!!
chassey default 2.1?
Ooooh dear sensor issues
"So this season is f1: Mercedes 

F1.5 : the rest of the grid"
Mercedes: setting multi 2-1 :D
"Mercedes crash, albon gets podium, george gets in the points, thats the dream."
"Does Vettel simply not give a damn anymore or is the Ferrari really that much of a shitbox? He can barely keep up with Kimi, who himself is stuck behind a Williams out of all things."
The season is over for Bottas
Repeat of Austria 2018 anyone? Double Merc retirement?
"Why do they cut away every time Merc get to the best overtaking zone? Not that Hamilton is getting close enough rn, but still"
Are these Mercedes going to shake themselves to pieces?
Albon gonna collect a win at this rate
Multi 21 2: electric boogaloo
LEWIS IS HERE.
"Double merc issues incoming, easy Albon #1"
Doesn’t look like they’re letting them race... Lewis not moving much
Why are the curbs being blamed for so much today??
Surely Botham is a place somewhere in the UK?
"""Stop driving on the bouncy bits!"""
mercs are SO FAR in front of everyone it's hilarious
Anyone know if mercedes is using DAS?
"This ""sensor issue"" code is such BS, I wonder what the actual problem is. Oil system issues like Honda had back at McLaren when they shook the engine apart?"
But mooooom Bottas is on the kerbs too!
LET THEM RACE
Imagine both Mercs DNF because they’re ignoring the sensor issues 😂
This Merc's with half the car broken would still be faster than the rest of the cars
The curb must be a drug because these 2 are addicted
Shaking they asses apart 🥴
Mercedes explosions incoming
Bono pls
Can we see the other cars now? They've been showing the mercs for at least 5 minutes now.
Two seconds Ted
"2 secs Ted  
  
God did we ever need F1 back"
"""He's doing it more than me :(("""
Merc will run into traffic soon
"Stay off the kerbs for these two, means use all the kerb you want lol"
Be nice to see something else now please
Valterri's aggressive defending vs Hamilton's outrageous will to win vs multi 21: Toto edition. Sounds fun
Was this problem the one that Ricciardo got
Bottas got lucky today
"CRITICAL ISSUE, PLEASE BLOW UP"
"""*Gearbox issue is critical*"""
Enough Mercs for today. Show the midfield
Well at least I'll get some racing at IMS today
I think they want someone to stay off something ? Or something
Brundle has a dictionary in the commentary box :D
Poo critical issue. Fast lap incoming.
It’s going to be pretty boring from here on out
I am so happy if Alex gets his first podium today 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Damn really worry about Merc PU reliability
No.. Come on Bottas. Don't be in worse shape than Lewis.
Any update on a Perez penalty for unsafe release?
So Mercedes can't use the curbs and albon still can't close the gap.....
Digging that last radio transmission ngl
Even Rona cant destory F1 memes
"AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA ""VALTERI WE NEED YOU TO SLOW DOWN"""
Vettel is taking longer to get past Russell than Kimi did...
"I think the Sensor Issues at Mercedes are real, cause they learned fron the Retirement from stroll‘s Mercedes/Racing point"
Really hope its serious and they go on the kerbs
Guys im kinda hoping for a Spain 2016
Bottas told over radio - We are in worse shape than the other car.
Show someone who isn’t Mercedes ffs
Boys we might get lucky here
Call me dumb but how are even red and white curbs damaging their cars?
We are in worse shape than other cars. Looks like we'll only finish 1-2.
Feels like Merc have freezed
And if Max were still in he could fly by the Mercs right now...
LETS GO DOUBLE RETIREMENT!
James is BDE
Mercc goes boom when?
1 thing i absolutely hate is how when ted talk they'll ALWAYS cut him off with a radio.
This is where there should have been a car pushing them just a second or two behind. Not where Albon is :( missing the Ferrari of last year and Verstappen.
Double Merc retirement incoming
"“Valterri, this is James...”

*oh fuck, not again*

“...please stay off the kerbs”

*whew*"
"""You said the red-white ones were okay, right?"""
Rus vs Vet not a battle i'd have expected
Something is gonna give
"Turned into a nice, relaxing sunday afternoon drive.."
Show someone else ffs!
Can't believe I am seeing a shitbox Williams and a shitbox Ferrari fighting and shitbox Ferrari is the car behind
Crofty is having none of Ted’s rambling “insights” today.
F1 2020 Mercedes vs. Kerbs
Does nothing happen in the rest of the field?
Lmao are they even trying to stay off the kerbs
"Crofty: ""it makes it badder right ted?""

Ted: ""I think it's just worse""

Love Crofty man."
Ferrari struggling to pass a Williams. What year is this?
All the hype gone lmao
It’s just some theatrics from the Oscar winning Mercedes
Never heard the word kerb so much before in my life
"After a long time, race is finnaly here..and it's the most boring thing I've witnessed since this year started"
Albon's win hype
Lol ferrari not able to overtake a fucking williams
There’s other cars in this race? News to me.
"Nothing else going on in this race so lets just watch to see which Mercedes uses kerbs slightly more than the other

\*sigh\*"
just a bit sad that Albon is 11sec back and can't even put on a hint of pressure while the mercs play a game of kerbs are lava :(
Are there any other cars on track? I wouldn't know because they're only filming the two Mercedes!
COME ON ESTEBAN !
The gap is ridiculous
I feel like we've been looking at the Merc's for the last 7 laps...look at other fucking cars.
The only pass Ferrari have made all race is Vettel on a broken Stroll right? What a car
Lando getting 4th calling it now
Wait a second these cars aren’t mercs
I feel like we're in 2014
A safety car now would bring Albon in a very good position
Dead race unless a repeat of 2018 happens
lmao Grosjean just retire already
"hey merc bois! go all out, please get as many kerbs as you can, grind your gears, shift at redline and go maximum attack on your tires. Let's see what blows up first"
Why can't Haas just get their shit together?
Gro seems to have got lost
Aaaaand there goes Grosjean
Haas should give me some money since they like lighting it on fire
WTF Grosjean
Grosjean taking the scenic route around
Does grosjean have a contract for next year? Hope not
Absolutely awful directing for this race. Such a shame.
Haas is such a disaster
please press F for ferrari
"Race has been neutered.

Time to switch to some footy"
Grosjean mate you're supposed to avoid the gravel not drive on it
Grosjean out exploring
Two brake failures for Haas - how come their cars never work properly?
More Haas brake failure?
Noooooo russel
"Haas quits F1 next year, heard it here first"
Grosjean. Again.
This is like a bad rain race.. cars dropping everywhere.
Haas already in mid-season form.
Russell lost power. Welp.
THIS WILL BE A FUCKING BIG SAFETY CAR
Haas are a joke
Safety car
Noooooo Georgy. That's the 2nd Merc engine
"lol at this point, the Mercedes will really be the only ones left on the track"
Safety car incoming?
Grosjean taking the scenic route
NOOOOO RUSSELL
"Wtf is this race, did we go back in time?"
"George, nooo!"
NOOOOOO
GEORGE NO!!!!!!!!!!!!
RIP Russel...
"Poor George, he was going so well."
Wrong Mercedes losing power here. Now whatever fight Bottas and Hamilton were pretending to have is definitely going to get nipped in the bud.
Safety car
For fucks sakes
Merc no longer bulletproof
Russell NOOO.
i hope perez tires will break soon
Haas once again looking like a bunch of wankers
Russell :'( dammit!
Safety car deployed
Fuuuuck what is this race? the only teams left will be Merc...
Wow the retirements
Brakes again
Holy fuck will anyone be left at the end of the race?
At this rate half the field will be dead
Another safety car?!?!
"omg Haas knew they had brake problem and they let Grosjean out, not good"
Both Haas with braking issues out
WHAT IS HAPPENING
"OH BOY SAFETY CAR

Alex gets a free pass to close to the Mercedes who have to avoid all the kerbs"
Well that sucks. Russel was having such a great day.
Hamilton and Bottas were still setting fastest laps even with the kerb issue. Albon still needs to find pace if he's to pass one or both.
"I missed it, did Gros lose it on his own or was that a failure?"
NOW IS YOUR CHANCE ALBON
SC could be spicy if Merc can't go full pelt
Hopefully George's sacrifice will mean a win for Albon
Let’s fucking go!
Is Russell competitive in a top tier car?
Those last 20 laps are going to be wild.
Looks like Albon and Norris will  get their 1st podiums together.
"Who's next, who's next"
"Poor Russel, gutted."
Albon has a Chance right now
It’s a yoke that leclerc didn’t take soft
Bottas fuming rn
"Now we get to see if the Mercs were full of shit with their ""issues"" or if they're actually struggling."
"Comon Albon, you got this"
Lol Grosjean had zero confidence in the breaks and coasted in and they still failed...
"Damn, this race has not been kind to the cars. I can’t even imagine the frustration of waiting so long to race again only to DNF."
Albon going for the win.
"F1.com/vote. 

Bernd Mayländer best driver of the race"
"George Russell is the second Mercedes to have a mechanical issue, that likely won't make the main Mercedes team feel good."
Let’s go Albon!
"At this point, give me another GOATsly podium pls. 😫"
Vettel is in full piss off and just give me my money mode. And I absolutely love him for it.
This race is radiating so much chaotic energy
Perez with 25 lap old mediums...
"perez third, but can he survive with those mediums"
[deleted]
The curbs there are just so much harder than on other tracks...
"Albon, Perez, and Norris have a genuine chance at getting past the Mercs on the restart, and they *might* be able to hold em off by being able to take the better lines through the rest of the race. Hell yeahhh"
Is this amount of retirements normal for a race?
No one embracing the new Hard Wet meta?
They just gave P3 to Perez. Hope that wasn't the wrong decision.
Come on Albon
Extremely risky move leaving Perez out
Thai Bottas ftw
And George sacrificed for a good race
"The next F1 2020 video game will just be a battle royale, last survivor wins the race."
ALBON WIN LETS GO
wish max was there in the softs there as well
"At this rate, you might get points even laps down as long as you are still running."
Hopefully albon can do something with the softs
"Albon and Norris, now is your time!"
Vettel vs Raikkonen should be interesting
Albon could win this if he gets a good restart
COME IN ALBONOOOO
Albon do it for prince Bira!
ALEX GONNA DO IT FOR MAX
Albon about to do a pro gamer move
COME ON ALEX
JUICYYYYY
Mediums on the McLaren not softs? Wtf
DO IT ALBON PLS
Fee-fee Latifi is gonna finish in the top 10 if these retirements continue lol
I'm surprised Perez didn't stop with his medium tires
i cant believe fucking merc
Merc staying out looks stupid at this point
Alex! Alex!Alex!!!
"This race has all of 2019 so far. Renault engine failure, Williams on last place, Vettel spin, Mercedes 1-2, Haas brake problems..

Edit: Also, Albon vs Hamilton Brazil, so if Hamilton gets a penalty, then a late podium for McLaren."
Ted interrupted
I'm getting Brazil 19 vibes from this
"Sainz will be fine with he tyre advantage, but it's a shame that he can't immediately attack Leclerc"
Why didn't McLaren double stack
"Ted must be so sad at the end of the day, all the good points and jokes he was going to make, just to get cut off :("
Albon winning would be so 2020.
Of course it's the Finnish flag
"Albon on new softs, Perez on old mediums, evil empire on old hards"
This has been a reliability battle so far but it might just be a race to the finish line from here on out.
Perez please hermano🙏
Latifi Up to 14th
Perez could do something here
Merc 1(2020)-2(2020)-3(2019)
Can't wait until the second season of 2020
Socially distanced spectator.
Albon *has* to be excited right now
did norris pit under the safety car?
Imagine if a RP wins. What timeline is this
COME ON ALEXXXXX!!!
Austria looks so lovely
the mountain shot we been waiting for
Mercedes 1-2-3 right now.
Things just got kind of exciting again.
"Honestly this is very reminiscent of 2014. Mercs 1-2, Red Bull behind them, and Ferrari Midfield"
Is Mercedes the only one with these issues hitting the curb? They haven't stated anything regarding the other teams and hitting the curbs.
Vettel second to last lmao
Safety car better watch those kerbs
Why didnt mercedes pit?
Come on Alex
Sweet baby Jesus. Ferrari second to last?
I hope Norris gets the jump.
Why do they talk to Christian Horner exclusively? Why not any other team principal?
"I want to give up, I've gotten a load of friends to tune in for this race and it's just Mercedes social distancing lap after lap"
Inb4 SC breaks down from running the kerbs.
Albon charge incomingggg
"My f1 fantasy is fkced, Ricciardo, Russell, Grosjean retired...  


Just Perez Turbodriver (being hunted down by Albon on Softs) and Hammy stuck behind bottas left :("
Alex cmon
BLUE BALLS
I take back what i said about this race probably going to be boring
"Wow max would've won this race had he not retired. Literally perfect strategy.

FUCK"
This season is haunted.
Mercedes so lucky
Don't make Albon give that back pls
BLUEBALLED
This race is like Germany last year but on crack
Alfa Romeo is going to get slapped hard for that
"Well, I certainly enjoyed that 20 seconds of racing."
What the hell is happening today!?
annnnnd that's gg
Kimi's tire fell off... that's not supposed to happen
BWOAH
Bruh this race is crazy
Last 10 laps will be mega
Somebody failed to do their job
That could have been dangerous
Did the tire fly off the rim?
"Holy hell, this looks like an amateur hour!"
Fuck this is wild
Sprint race!
Kimi's tyre: My people need me.
The cars sound like pod racers running over those curbs.
GET ALEX BACK AHEAD
Shitshow decent for a first race.
"Oof, someone pit team is in trouble."
Massive? LOL Wut?
That tyre just yeeeted itself off track
Jesus that's dangerous!
"Race is sloppy as hell, everyone’s rusty"
Kimi still working tire-lessy with 40 years wow
jesus christ
The wheel fell off.
did perez take that place back under safety car?
Did the mechanic forget something?
"Wheel said ""fuck it im out"""
"I've never seen a tire just fall off like that, that suspension must have been fucky."
I think checo might have to hand that back
that was fucking close to the ferrari
Albon cheated out of a place there.
He drove the wheels off
Well there’s your problem
At this rate latifi could get his first point before russel
Latifi 12th! Come on we can get a williams in the points this race!
That restart completely blue balled me
Albono totally sent it. Unlucky safety car.
Why come back onto the track?
I've never seen a tyre fall off like that what?
"I disagree with Sky, I think Albon was just behind as the SC came out."
Kimi:(
This race is actual comedy
That could have killed somebody
7 DNFs already. An all this SC is just helping Mercedes with their sensor.
Oh wow!! Thank goodness there isn’t a crowd today
Crazy race
They should give Albon his position
Who’s in third? Should be albon.
"Even though nothing happened, I'm super glad we have the halo now. That shit's scary"
the front fell off
Latifi might end up scoring a point before Russell!
"Feel like Oprah is calling the shots ""YOU CAN HAVE A SAFETY CAR, YOU CAN HAVE ONE!"""
My only guess is that the wheel nut failed? Or wasn't properly secured?
Wrong colour car Austrian Curbs!
So is that a improperly attached tyre from a pitstop then?
I am loving the madness. Only 13 left!
God i love it:)
Perez penalty inc?
An eventful yet depressing race
"Come on Albon, do it."
WELCOME TO REPLAY 12 OF KIMI’S TYRE.
At this rate - everyone who finishes will be in the points.
This race is a perfect metaphor for 2020
Another RedBull protest incoming against the Mercedes of Perez!
have a drink kimi
And all of these yellow laps are helping Valteri and Lewis.
Surely RB will be onto race control.
"Decided to try F1 fantasy this year. My team was Verstappen, Riccardo, Kimi, Sainz, and Perez. So Sainz and Perez are gonna DNF in the last few laps"
This was ideal for Russell :(
"That onboard is unintentionally hilarious, the tyre just goes ""alright bye"""
Kachow!
"Praise the ragazzi, Vettel is probably getting some points🥳"
"First GP of the season always seems to be a bit weird, and this year's might be even more so."
"The front fell off D:

This is an AMAZING RACE"
Kimi will be out the paddock and headed home before the end of the race
This is awesome.
What the actual fuck is this race? 7 retirements?
Latifi knicking a living out here
Oh how I've missed this.
Softs are super good considering the race distance left!!
Alfa Romeo using experimental strats this year to get the edge on the competition
This is turning into Aus ‘08
Formula 1: Warzone
Alex should get his place back from Perez
These kerbs are just trying to imitate the Austin kerbs from last year
"Albon has enough laps to finish on the softs with enough wear, and Mercedes are on the hards and have limited track room Shit is about to go down"
Latifi might get a point at this rate.
"Take out the mercs, seb and latifi get points ez"
Bono my sensors are gone
Albon ahead lets go
C'mon let's go racing againnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!
"""Can you say that again?"" ""Sorry?"" - The COVID mask safe story of F1 this year haha"
ALBON P3 LETS GOOOOOOOO
Albon P3!
YES ALBON ❤️❤️❤️
Albon allowed to go past Perez again?
Got to assume Hamilton will be ordered to hold up Albon
Albon has taken 3rd by themselves. Can they do that?
Could cure cancer during this safety car period
"Hi guys. Was just browsing around during Premier league half time break and stumbled upon the F1 race live event, my first one really. Are these accidents/safety incidents happening on the track a regular occurrence ? Or did I just choose the worst possible day to start watching F1 ?"
Albon back to third!
Get that safety car in dammit!
WARBON GO GET THEM MY BOI
Safety Car in...
"yess, I want albon!"
Yeah!!! Albon in P3!
7 retirements none are Ferrari and they still don't have a podium
99 awareness restart by Bottas
Mercs are gonna have to race. Cant turn stuff down now. Might have to let Lewis go if they want to win. Guess we will see
Verstappen must be seething. He probably won have won had the engine stayed intact
Albon is in a fantastic position now.
Team Albon/Kerb represent
Latifi is gonna get dragged kicking and screaming into the points.
FUCK SAKE
NO NOT AGAIN
Hamilton's done it again!
NOOO
AGAIN!!!!!!!!! :O
Bottas is fantastic at these safety car restarts.
Holy shit!!!!!!
Again are you fucking kidding me
FUCK
Go albon!!
That's one way to get VET into the points again...
Noooo Albon
FUCKING LEWIS HAMILTON!
Hamilton: nothing personnel kiddo
FUCKING LMAOOOOO
Wooooow
AGAIN OMG
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
NOOOO
"ALBON, NOT AGAIN"
This race is a dumpster fire.
Wtf not again!!! Alex why??
This can't be fucking real.
THAT IS FUCKING INFURIATING
WTF!
Oh my fucking goddddd
Lol what a joke
"Idk if that one’s on hamilton though

Also let’s go lando get on the podium kid!!!"
Wtfff
OH MY GOD NOT AGAIN NOOOOO
RIP alex
Fuck!!! Fuck Fuck Fuck! Third was better than this  for albon :(
Not again
I‘m getting Vietnam flashbacks
"Oh FFS, poor Alex."
What the fucking hell? Again?
Welp Mercedes 1-2 now
Fuck mee whyy again
"Hey, is this just a Brazil 2019 rerun?"
Ffs
"This is the first GP I ever watch, gotta say I'm entertained"
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
ALBON PATIENCE MY BOI
5 second time penalty incoming.
Alex you had ten laps left to make a move!!!   Fuuuuck
How the fuck does hamilton always comes UNHARMED??
IT'S BRAZIL ALL OVER AGAIN
Albon would have fucking won this race
If Tom Kristensen is the FIA steward this race... man Hamilton gon' get fucked
A penalty surely
Bruh moment
Shocker that Brundle is blaming Alex for that. Despite being on the outside
Holy shit this exact same scenario again
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Sorry guys. I started clapping too early when Albon was looking to pass.
Hamilton and Albon incident noted by stewards
NOT AGAIN FFS
"Oh good I just picture Lando yelling as he sees Alex spinning.  Why Lewis, why do you hate Albino?"
THIS IS LIKE REMIX OF THE 2019 SEASON
It's time for norris to have podium now!
Norris plssssss
Same shit different year
ALBONOOOOOO
AGAIN!!! Wtf!!
Hamilton’s got to get a penalty
YOU CANT FUCKING SCRIPT THIS
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
"Hamilton the blessed, the unbreakable, the unsanctionable."
"Oh, Alex."
Albon would be completely justified if he does that same shit to Hamilton next weekend.
Oh man Alex!! Not again!!!
Lewis hates Albon confirmed
Red Bull’s day just went: 📉📉📉📉📉📉
This is peak.
WHAT THE FUCK?
Albon noooooooo!
Mercedes 1 2 3?
Another protest incoming!!!
We're getting a Alex vs Lewis rivalry instead of the Max vs Lewis one
Get in Vettel
BREAK A MEEC MOTHERFUCKER
Martin was absolutely heartbroken.
Holy shit lmao.
oh nooooo albooon :(
I'm not sure I can keep watching.. This is way too much excitement after months of nothing....
Hamilton you absolute knob
Thats all on Lewis
Did Hamilton steer into him there
alex is impatient.
Fuck offfff mercedes
"They need to give Hamilton a penalty now
I called it in Brazil I call it now"
Why did they not give Perez fresh tires?
Hamilton penalty please
Did Sainz pass 2 cars off camera again
Hamilton must hate Albon. It's only fair he give Albon one of his WDC to make it up to him.
Go Lando goooooooo
"Move over Kvyat, there’s a new torpedo in town"
COME ON PEREZ AND NORRIS YOU TWO ARE MY ONLY HOPE
"Hamilton penalty, Perez 2nd, Lando 3rd incoming"
Definitely worth at least a look from the stewards
Albon doesn’t deserve that
So unlucky Albon. He was clear and got taken out.
It's Morris Crofty... Seriously..
That's Lando dumbass
tfw Max had the pace to win
God damn nearly lost leclerc there
Leclerc is actually going to smeg it to 3rd. Wtf ferrari
leclerc FLYING!!
That’s it. Merc 1-2-3.
OH MY GOD NOT AGAIN
Albono got too greedy tbh
Norris is going to Ferrari?
dam norris :(
le©️ler©️ goin hard
"See, Lewis, you can allow a guy to pass on the outside"
"LMAO, the cherry on top would be a Ferrari on the podium"
I swear with our luck both Mercedes' gearboxes will fall apart the moment they cross the finish line in a 1-2 finish
Fuck
Imperial March intensifies...
Sainz you fast bugger.
LEC podium would be miracle
Scenes if Ferrari gets a podium! :D
Ferrari looks lit. 🔥
Fuck this race. Fuck everything about it 😤😤😤
Lelerc and Norris managed that corner just fine.
"Scratch that.

Go Perez!"
Charles if you take this pink podium away from me I swear to god
"Charles may get a podium now, what an amazing turn of events"
Vettel just got passed by Giovannazi...
Leclerc is honestly one hell of a talented driver. How he’s dragged that shit box up to 4th with all this chaos is amazing.
"Leclerc is looking pretty good, considering how poor they qualified."
Come on charles. Come on.. come onnnn
Lerclerc with that Rapidviertelstunde
LOL after all this its going to be two mercs and a ferrari on the podium isn't it?
Ferrari doesn't even deserve this good a result tbh
Feel bad for Norris.
FUCK YES PENALTY
Ferrari gonna get second
LETS GO CHARLES!!
Fuck leclerc
Leclerc p2.
"Come on Charles, take all the energy!"
Easy for Leclerc?
Oh shit there's the penalty
Merc fucked themselves by not pitting for softs
I'm hoping Lando is able to work a leclarec for a tow
Only 5 seconds?
lec 2nd
Charles 2nd cause Time Penalty for Lewis
Did David Croft forget how to speak English over the covid break???
"Ferrari to get second after all that, haha"
"Leclerc gonna get 2nd, what is happenin?"
Ferrari gonna get on the podium.
Leclerc pole??
HOLY FUCK A FERRARI EFFECTIVELY IN P2
Holy fucking shit Leclerc is probably 2nd
big disappointment if there's nobody new on the podium
Only 5 seconds
This race is fucking excellent
Holy shit this race has had it all!
"iT WAsnT LeWiS' FAulT. Yeah sure dumbasses, that's why he got the penalty."
Albon really could’ve won this
"Lol, Ferrari on the second spot. Amazing."
OMFG OMFG LECLER I LOVE YOU
5 seconds is a yoke
"Leclerc P2 in a crappy ferrari. Perez P3, yes mate!"
"I love Checo, but I want Lando on the podium"
LECLERC WOW
This race is fucking fire
LANDO PODIUM I BEG
"YES, CHARLES!!"
Clearly everyone was predicting that Ferrari would finish second this race.
"Ferrari gets a podium out of nowhere.

Fair play Charles!"
This was Ferraris plan all along
All part of the Ferrari master plan^TM
"Can they start factoring in previous for Hamilton soon? Grid penalty and time deleted already this weekend, and a 5 second penalty in his last race for punting Albon too.

When does that start mattering?"
Coverage is SO MUCH BETTER without the crowd shots.
Ferrari finally removing the sandbags just 5 laps away from the finish line..
Craaazy race!!!
Leclerc is P3 in a shitbox!
"Charles is going for 2nd place ??!!!

Meanwhile Vettel got overtaken by an Alfa Romeo."
Now this is racing!
ferrari second place!! WOOO
Damn straight. Take that 5 sec. Hamilton. That was a cheap shot.
FORZAA CHARLES
Ferrari and the war of attrition strategy working out
Man what a start to the season.
Lewis is pushing now.
THIS RACE IS MEMEY AS FUCK BUT IM NUTTING WHOAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYEYEEEEEEEE
GRAZZIE RAGAZZI INTENSIFIES
Leclerc you fucking beauty.
What the fuck is going on in this race.
"Ouch, Mercedes does fastest laps on hard, I hope he can't make 5 seconds gap."
Norris almost on podium!!
That replay actually makes that penalty seem fair
I can't believe Leclerc going to finish 2nd after all of the issues ferrari has had this weekend.
P3 for Norris now right
How is this ferrari going to end up in second place?
NORRIS PODIUM?!
LANDO GONNA POLE
"Ah, yeah. I get it now with the overhead.

All about trajectory. Lewis didn't straighten up enough for Albon to keep his line.

Fair enough."
"Perez penalty, Hammy stays on the podium

AND ALBON OUT"
LANDO DO IT BOY
This race is fucking incredible
"To make it up to Hamilton, they will give everyone but Bottas a penalty"
LANDO ON THE PODIUM LADS!!
Albon gone
The last 15 laps have been super entertaining lol
THIS RACE IS A MADNESS
LANDO LOL
YES LANDOOOOOO
NORRIS COULD GET A PODIUM
It's good that Hamilton got a penalty but how annoyed would you be if you were Albon. Twice getting knocked off the podium
These stewards need to do every race. World class
CMON LANDO!
Loooooool what perez
"WHAT IS HAPPENING, ALL THOSE BUMPING INTO EACH OTHER"
Come on Norris! Get that podium
I’m sorry but I disagree with that penalty. Albon turned into him. But whatever.
What an absolute shit show this is
Norris is on surely
LANDO PODIUM PLEEEEEEEEASE
Someone please help me understand what the fuck is going on
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON
That's a racing incident...off-cambre corner it just pushes you out.
HAHAHAHA THIS RACE
ALBON IS OUT ANYWAY
This Hamilton penalty is a joke. Albon should have seen where HAM's racing line was.
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS RACE??
THIS RACE IS WILD AF
Please don‘t let this race stop
"i swear to god, if this is a safety car lmao"
LETS GOOOO
"Bottas slow, let Ham pass to hold up the rest?"
Perez is probably going to get another penalty for that
Give us a safety car and we get double McLaren podium!
I almost stopped watching about a half-hour ago.  Glad I didn't.
MY MAAAAAAANNN LANDOOOOO!
Rubbin is racin baby
Disasterous race for Red Bull
VETTEL BACK IN THE POINTS BABY!
Is Perez not looking around him? Hello????
YO NORRIS!
Omg what is happening
hahahahah WTF IS THIS RACE
Landooooooo get in
They are all driving as if this was a video game.....
"It took 8 cars retiring, albon getting fucked and hamilton getting a penalty to get Leclerc a podium"
"Come on, send it Lando!!!!"
this is wild
How is speeding in the pit the same pentaly as ruining albon's chance to win? Thats crazy to me
"If Albon intentionally triggers a safety car to screw Lewis, he will be my hero"
This has been a much better race than it seemed like it would be after Saturday
COME ON NORRIS!!!
what a shit show
LATIFI!
I FUCKING CANNOT
One more DQ and Latifi will be on points...hahahah
wtf is this race lol
Aaand another one
I don't really blame lando there.
COME ON LANDO COME ON!
What a race. Does anyone cross the line?
Norris has 2 laps to catch hamilton a bit PUSH
Wtf!! 9th car???
This race lol. Its not even raining.
What is this race
Bottas pls back up Hamilton so Lando is on the podium...
Are y'all not entertained
Latifi just needs one more retirement lmao
Latifi is so close
11 cars out
KVYAT
Like the good old days: barely half the cars manage to finish the race.
Nine fucking dnfs and Latifi still can’t get a point
SAFETY CAR PLEEAASE
"Bloody hell Perez, nearly took Norris out."
what the fuck is going on
"Come on Norries get in there son

Edit: Norris* hahahaha"
Latifi for rookie points pls
"Nobody gets the constructors trophy this race, just fuck it"
Get latifi to points
Seems like the points are participation points for all.....
Meme lord on the podium?
NORRIS LEGEND
THIS IS ABSOLUTE MADNESS
"F1 2020 looks extremely realistic, might buy it on PC later"
How many cars will finish!?!?
"Teams with 2 cars left:  
  
* Ferrari 
* McLaren 
* Mercedes"
"If Mercedes want 1-2, they should swap then around"
come on Norris
CMON NORRIS GET HIM
DID NORRIS DO IT
So a pretty thin starting field next week.

Practically half the grid gone

"What a great way to start this season a full on chaos race to start everything off and we are back for another one next week.

Ferrari got to be the most lucky team today, straight up no pace for most of the race and still end up in P2 lmao

EDIT: Also the RP strategy department is horrible"
NOOOOORRRIIISSS

NORRIS!!!! NORRIS!!!!!
LAAAAAAAANNNNNDDDDOOOOOOO!

Can't believe my stream kicked the bucket 3 laps from the end smh
let this be a reminder to make sure you take your car on a Sunday cruise every now and then so it doesn't seize up
Yesssss Lando!!!!!!!
What a finish. Well done Lando! Amazing drive!
I’m actually excited for the next race now. With such a mess of a race a lot of drivers will want to redeem themselves
Fuck my stream stopped in the last 2 laps
All that Sim racing payed off. Amazing Lando
HE DID IT LANDOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Get in there Lando!!!!
FUCKING AMAZING FOR MCLAREN
LANDO YOU GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDDDD
Albon driver of the day!
Landoooo! F1 is back boys!
Look how bad Seb looks now...could've been P5 or P6
"This track. 

Austrian GP is always awesome!"
GO LANDO BOT!!!!!!
LANDO FOR DOTD!
Can't wait for Lando's next twitch stream.
Albon died for this
"Well done Lando,"
Lol that cringe pre recorded fan cheering gif
"I‘m too old for this, MY HEART"
Albons dream died for Lando
Bottas... Ice man
Lando crashing into the p3 sign. Lol
Was Vettel car damaged? He fought with Gio all the time in the last laps
Lets fuckin go
"Mad race, awesome."
Albon vs. Hamilton = McLaren Happy
Go fuckin' mad Lando my boi
BALD HEADS MAKE FASTEST LAPS
MCLAREN AHEAD OF FERRARI AND RED BULL
LANDOOOOO
Williams so close to a point
I just yelled out loud! So hyped for Lando!
Norris👏👏👏
Hahah that run to zak is fantastic
Lando: boop
Mclaren only get weird podiums!
What a crazy podium!! Freaking great race!
Lando knocking over the sign is golden hahahaha
Vettel 1 point lol
Crown prince call incoming
Lando needs to finish in the top 3 more often to learn how to not hit the sign in front of the car :D
Landos celebration. Holy shit I'm crying
That was awesome
So happy for lando!
LANDO!!!!
That was pure king shit from Norris at the end there!! Hot damn 😎
What a race! Love the podium as well.
Speechless
So happy for Lando!
"What a sick race, so happy the season starts with this banger"
What a race!!!!
Race of attrition
"Cover your nose, you muppet!"
When was the last time so few drivers finished the race?
WAAAAAAAAAH! LANDOOOOO!!!1!!!!
What a race boys. Next week can’t come fast enough
I bet Lando and Lec are going on a drinking adventure to be joined by George and Albon to bitch about Ham/Mercedes
"What a fucking race, my god.  Absolutely exhilarating."
Really love those McLaren race suits.
"This podium is odd, but it is what it is."
"Well, true."
"LANDO!!

Great Race. Loved it all."
all well that ends well ...amazing race
Cool trophy
What a dude he just wanted to get his friends wet too
Just noticed that kimi has the fastest lap record here as well!!
"Here we go... Replays.

And still no Albon onboard?!!!"
Is there anything on after the race? ESPN stopped so I can’t watch that anymore
Wtf is Herbert talking about?
"Williams should look at Vettel, he sucks but he might bring in some sponsors."
if 2020 was summed up in a F1 race!!! :L
Hamilton penalty pls
Red Bull spent all weekend snitching and forgot to QA they car lol
All Vettels fault there
thats hamilton's fault
"BRAZIL 2019

AUSTRIA 2020

SAME EXACT ACCIDENT

WHAT THE FUCK.

ALBON HAD NOWHERE TO GO AND HE WAS ALREADY PAST HAMILTON"
Only 5 seconds for robbing Albon of a win.
God it feels amazing seeing Hamilton not on the podium
"That should be a penalty for Perez and Racing point. Can't fuck around in the pit lane, it puts a lot of people in danger."
Lewis is a a dirty fucker
[deleted]
Godverdomme
Praying for an engine problem at merc . No max now bored
"That had to have been a record for shortest amount of time for 2 pit stops by Mercedes, right?"
"Car made for him, still spins gg from the german."
Could use a Merc PU explosion here
"If the Ferrari remains as the ~4th fastest car on the grid then Vettel is definitely going to be exposed hard. He's got relatively poor racecraft for a WDC and simply can't handle not being at the front/not having the fastest car.

That was such a silly move that you wouldn't even expect from Latifi letalone a veteran like Seb.

Hopefully for him Ferrari can make some big upgrades so that he can move a bit higher up the grid where he'll be less likely to make mistakes."
Please have Lewis hit valterri
"""Urgent chassis default 21"" = 2020 version of Multi-21?"
Please double retirement. Please.
That’s surely a penalty for Hamilton
"And OF COURSE the Merc just drives on like nothing happened. Not only do they have the best car, but they also have the LUCKIEST fucking car"
Albon could of won the race
"Ham deserves a penalty for this one, Albon was ahead."
"Yes Sky F1, yes, Albon was clearly ahead and it was obvious on the live feed. That ""you need patience"" claims were ridiculous."
How long has it been since McLaren podium?
Ok. Where can I buy that end racism shirt?
Max starting on mediums is looking very good now.
Damn when do we ever get to see the helicopter stunts? That was dope flying
I could not be more excited. F1 is fucking back.
"this threads moving so quick. i can admit my girlfriend finds Lando more attractive then i am. and tbh, I agree"
[deleted]
Lando is a sitting duck
Verstappen with a good Pace with the medium tyres. It is a contender for the Win.
Finally Mercedes 1-2!!!
Wonder who Horner is going to blame now that Renault is gone
Sounds like a gearbox failure
"Well, thats the race. Good day everyone! See you at the next one. Yawwwwwwn"
"Look like Max pressed the ""Stall Car"" button... why do we even have that button!"
"Well, have fun with another Merc dominated season"
"Max Verstappen, world record holder - latest first retirement of the season in F1."
"“Ah Mercedes 1-2 , as it should always be “ - Thanos"
I really want seb to get something out of this. Please.  Lewis has lucked out here.
"This is gonna be such a shit season.

Only hope is Bottas but that is STILL a Merc winning ffs!"
Congratulations to Mercedes for winning the 2020 WDC and WCC
"2019 Max: GIVE ME POWER!

2020 Max: GIVE ME ANYTHING! PLEASE OH GOD!

Disappointing way to kick off the season for Max, but it's time for a spicy fight for P3 for everyone else."
So Ferrari can't overtake a Racing Point with a broken engine?
What did Lewis do in a past life to be blessed with such luck? Why does literally every single thing that happens in any given race benefit him
FUCK THIS ENTIRE SPORT
It's funny how consistently Mercedes' engine problems are primarily affecting their customer teams and not themselves
"New theory:

Everyone will have reliability issues EXCEPT for the now legal Ferrari. WDC and WCC inbound. Vettel to go out on number 5 after a thrilling season finale at Portimao."
I say we just hand the Mercs the championship and make a big deal about whoever finished 3rd this season.
"Just stepped away, mechanical issues for Verstappen?"
Sigh. Standard RIC in first race of the year :(
Lmao Max and Danny cursed by the 2017 and 2018 RB cars
Engines out there looking like a bunch of fucking vankers
Get Dan out of the Renault ASAP I’m so done with this team.
Classic Grosjean
"We all know how this will end. Hamilton wins followed by Bottas.

I can sense “Valtteri, it’s James” is coming."
"Only way for Ferrari to pass those cars was to have them retire, lmao what a shit of a car. Truly an achievement for the worst car ever"
"Fan or not of Max, without him the top 3 is so boring."
Ve look like a bunch of vankers!
Redbull has filed a complaint. Unsafe release by RP.
VSC would have done fine?
Kimi got screwed by that 😩
Now all we need is bot coming together with ham for a perfect exciting race
"Does Sky always ask Christian for a word? Or do they ask everyone and is Christian the only one who wants to talk  
  
Why doesnt he talk more shit to them"
"Honda engine ROFL

Alonso sends his regards"
Lewis sure does get lucky with SC v VSC
SEB WTF
"Verstappen out, Vettel spinning again, not a bad race."
"Classic vettel, lol"
Vettel drives like the season is over already. Can\`t blame him tbh
That's just poor driving by Seb.
"That's just frustration by Vettel, right? He was miles away for that send."
Seb making a stupid mistake. The world is returning to normal again.
Classic Race. It has everything we watch f1 for.
Mercs have already fucked off lmao
Seb trying to get fired?
Vettel has lost it.
Why does the Ferrari engine sound like my Rocket League Scarab?
The DRS is too strong between turns 3 and 4
How is latifi 13 seconds behind vettel. Just how
Hamilton turning it on now DRS is up. Could be a couple of nice laps.
"Damn, can I replace Lativi at Williams? I mean, I want to do evening stroll in a F1 car as well."
Shit is so easy that you can afford to let off a bit.
Sounds like a microphone from the 90s..
"Guys, Albon isn't dead. **HE** is the one on the podium."
I'd much rather they show the midfield instead of the Merc battle.
Man the Ferrari and Renault engines sound awful this year. Literally painful to listen to
impressed with Albon so far
Only reason to watch this is the possibility of an Albon podium now.
"Come on bottas, it’s your year"
Would love if Mercedes bashed one another. Great race behind them
I definitely would not mind seeing Checco on the podium!
Hamilton went to the same driving school as my mom
"Off the curb Lewis!!!! But mom, he’s taking more curb than me"
Mercedes double DNF???
"Come on Lewis, snitches get stitches."
"Apparently, both Mercedes drivers have been told they are having sensor issues 👀"
"Bottas out of DRS zone, phew"
f1 is interesting innit? there are only two cars competing 🤩
Does anyone else think this kerb thing is just not-very-cryptic team orders to make bottas give up position
Oh God. This is boring beyond belief. I fully understand why you guys have legitimate complaints about the racing.
Please have sensory issues please have sensory issues
"More curbs, more curbs!"
Bottas is fucked. He's going to shred his tyres as always.
Merc with issues but still far ahead of everyone
F1 every 5 secs: Hey guys did uk that aramco is a sponsor
please double retirement god please
"The ""END RACISM"" sign looks more like ""2ND RACISM"". Poor choice of font."
"If Max was still in the race, they would have team ordered to let Lewis through because he's faster. Lewis tires would be 'dead' and we'd still end up with a  Merc 1-2"
How cool soon max on fresh soft be vs Mercedes on the hards.
The cars are in shambles
WE LOOK LIKE A BUNCH OF FOCKING WANKERS
Penalty to checo
"I’ve been watching this race for 15 minutes. 

More has happened in the last 15 minutes than 90% of the races in the last 5 years."
"Imagine the scenes if Latifi gets 1 point from this race, and then neither driver gets any more points for the rest of the season."
Albon has a chance at not just a podium and maybe even more if the Merc sensor issue is actually as critical as it's being made out to be!
Lewis hates Albon doesn't he /s
HAMILTON YOU BASTARD
Hahahahahahahaha haha. Lewis with is standard defensive move.
That was on Hamilton. Look at all that room to Hamilton's right.
Hamilton has to get a penalty for that
Imo that’s Lewis’s fault
Hamilton told over radio - Chassis default 52 Urgent 5 2
LEWIS DONE DID HIM AGAIN
I think that's Hamilton's fault. There's not width there and he's well behind...
Lewis not leave da space
Hamilton penalty = Lando Podium PLEASE
The garage shot hurt.
Apparently Lewis HAS been playing F1 2019
5 second penalty just doesn't seem like enough for ruining Albon's race again.
Ferrari don’t deserve a podium
How in the world did LeClerc manage to pass in that donkey of a car?
Lewis got a 5 sec boiss.
YESSSS
FUCK U LEWIS
fuck hamilton take that 5
Charlie with some brilliant damage limitation
Is this Leclerc in 2nd because of the penalty
NORRIS IS ON THE PODIUM OMG
Merc need to do a switch with Bottas so lewis can get second and Bottas hold them off
"Bottas cost Lewis pole and cost him 3rd, lol"
Wow. That was an excellent race. Mercedes not looking as unbeatable as we first thought
Ferrari must feel justified in their faith in LeClerc. The contrast between him and Vettel today was stark.
"Mercedes threw an easy one-two away not pitting for new tires, wouldn't have had to give albon a chance that way smh. Strategy at safety cars always their weakness that everyone overlooks due to the  pasta makers"
Poor Albon
lol my friend is throwing a fit of how someone shook bottas's hand and then bottas touched his face
Has Mercedes always been so dominant ?
That is so fucking brutal. I don’t even know who to feel pissed off at or who to blame. Fuck it. Put it down to 2020
Horner trying to figure how to protest Mercedes for this
"Apology for poor English

Wen were u when red bull dies 

I was sat at home eating bell cheese when dmitri ring 

“Max is kill”

“No!”"
"Grosjean 🤣🤣

Still doesn't beat the time he crashed in the pits looool"
Vettel spinning out... Nature is healing.
I swear if they ask Bottas to let Hamilton by I’ll hunt down James
Mercedes downfall can’t come soon enough.
I AM SO FUCKING SICK OF DAVID CROFT AND IT'S NOT EVEN THE END OF RACE 1.
My aim in life is to be as petty as Lewis
"Previous 47 laps reddit: ""OMG Team orders SUCK if they give Lewis the lead. WE HATE TEAM ORDERS""

Now: Team orders in favour of Bottas make sense and are the BEST!!"
Hamilton doesn't seem to have a lot of respect for Albon lol.
So where can I find an illegal stream since F1TV Pro doesn't want to honor their contract with me?
"At the beginning of the race, Albon pushed Hamilton there, he yielded. Albon tries it, Hamilton pushes him out and Albon doesn’t yield, and it goes like that."
Albon won't kneel next week
Please let the merc engines explode... please.
"That's a stupid move for Albon to make, let's be honest, hamilton is full lock and no way hes able to give albon space"
Hamilton awareness= 0
This is what I hate about F1. The cars are basically driveable computers and a small error can lead to the car failing completely.
SkySports will blow air for anyone with a UK flag smh
#Spinella
"Yes, lets show Ocon in 10th instead of the battle for 1st"
What is the point of Latifi?
"These kerbs are absurd. They just destroy cars, it’s a ridiculous thing to put next to the track."
So the Mercedes are really fragile? That is great news.
"How hard was it to say ""Triple Bad""?

As opposed to ""Even badder""?

Lordy…"
Perez deserves an unsafe release penalty and to be swapped with Albon right now if the stewards were using their brains.
Fucking not again. Lewis wtf
The Classic HAM defensive move
Albon should have waited he had time
"I stg, if they don't give Hamilton a penalty"
Everyone wants racing - until it’s Hamilton. Seen so many moves like that where the argument is just let them race..
God I hope both Mercs break down
How about if that official pulled his mask up to cover his nose?! The fuck..
hope we can chill out now that no one knelt during the anthem.  Good to see all the drivers supporting the completely uncontroversial position to end racism.
Great! So that's the Merc 1-2 guaranteed. Without new regs they might as well give Hamilton the WDC.
Merc 1-2 confirmed already in lap 13. See you in 2021 bois
This safety car has killed the strategy intrigue as well. F1 doesn't disappoint in disappointing.
Vettel had no right to be there
BROOO LEWIS WHAT THE FUCK
Hamilton pentaly surely ? He pushed albon off when he had position
Sky cannot be more biased towards Hamilton if they tried
Please Mercedes double retirement
"SHOW THE LEADERS!

SHOW THE MIDFIELD!

WHY THE FUCK ARE WE SEEING MERCEDES?

WHY THE FUCK WONT THEY SHOW MERCEDES?

WAH WAH WAH THE LOT OF YOU"
"That was albons line, Hamilton pushed him"
"He should've been more patient, c'mon Albon"
That was Lewis's error.
5 penalty is a JOKE...should be 10 or a drive through
"Wow do I really have to listen to this commentary all season, it's only the first race and I'm already sick of the Hamilton excuses."
Hamilton =dirty driver
"There you go. Wasn't during a national anthem. Feel like some of those excuses were kind of bullshit tbh. Big ups to Ocon who was late af, legged it then immediately kneeled."
"Mercedes is so dumb. If they had Bottas move over, Lewis still could have locked up 3rd and Bottas still wins."
Is VER officially on 2?
Ever wonder why they don't like talking to the media? it's questions like that
The pre race doesn't feel the same without Martin's gridwalk
2nd racism?
Is this the race thread or the f1tv bitching thread?
"Both Ferraris in the points, this would be such a big result for a team like that if they can hold it"
"Ok, forget about Merc, let's just give them the title and exclude them from every race. Everywhere else this season is going to be amazing. GO ON LANDO!"
Checo holding off Charles isn't something I expected so soon
Norris!! No!
Horner going to protest against Red Bull now?
Horner to blame Renault
Time to turn the tv off :(
Yes Russell P18 now 🤣
"well, see you in 2022"
*formal protest*
No max is out?? We waited months for racing and he’s out on lap 11.  No way. I wish they’d move the new cars up sooner. Mercedes seems like the only top level team which isn’t much fun.
And now the dreaded 1-2 win for Mercedes
"217 days waiting for F1 to return for another easy Mercedes 1-2
Ahh some things really never change"
God the ferrari looks like a shit box
What's absolutely beautiful is that Netflix are covering Red Bull this weekend.
I’m starting to believe that Toto is a witch
"Ah well, it'll end with Bottas p1 and LH p2. No way for Lewis to catch up 8 seconds without a safety car here. ZZzzzZz"
"How is Leclerc still behind Tracing Point, Jesus."
"F1 is back baby snooze fest with merc 1-2 lets gooo

Edit: If youve been dying to see some actual racing this weekend, I would suggest watching a replay of the NASCAR xfinity series race yesterday at Indianapolis. Very tight racing with battles all the way to the end!"
"Williams are doing very well, Latifi only 5seconds off Grosjean!"
Both Norris and Checo absolutely humiliating the Ferrari's you love to see it.
Stroll has an engine problem.
"Ferrari is so slow in sector 3 that Vettel doesn’t have DRS in the pit straight. Wtf. 

Vettel/Leclerc/Danny Ric in a Racing Point would be fighting for a podium."
"Please I’m enjoying this race, stroll be okay"
Already 3 mechanical problems. Feels like back in the day.
Ted is doing a great job being in the grandstands
What a shitshow this is so bad
Renault back on their bullshit
Ricciardo and a DNF name a more consistent combo
"Me yesterday: Ferrari are a solid midfield team 

Me today: not really all that solidly in the midfield tbh"
Grosjean last place. Yeah his career is finished
RoGro being RoGro
Grosjean 'ah shit here we spin again'
Ocon get those points
Man.. What a shitshow this race. I'm so sad. Come on Alex and Norris. At least get 2 and 3.
LMAO Grosjean never change
"Yellow flag at some point pls, at least give us a Hamilton v Bottas battle"
"""One of our cars just retired with a sensor issue...erm a Racing Point I mean"""
[deleted]
Here's hoping for the Merc boys to crash into each other and double DNF... fingers crossed...
Haas doing Haas things
#BLOODY FOOKIN WANKAS
Magnussen gone off. Netflix about to record another Steiner rant.
Bunch of wankas
The teams have to relearn building these cars without issues.
"Great, that safety car just ruined all the battles on the track"
Oof that’s gonna be a penalty.
"Both Mercedes to crash out. Albon leading until the end when his Renault craps out. We will still have a Mercedes win, but it will be the pink one."
"C'mon Christian, you also did it just to fuck with Merc's heads"
I swear if I hear that “valtteri it’s James“ radio message I’m going to fucking flip
How are people calling this race boring? Its not even half through and we've had 4 failures and a safety car
Lol spinnnn
SBINELLA
Sainz kicking Vettel out of the race like he did from Ferrari
Can see Mr.Ferrari ripping Carlos's contract up
Here we go spinning again. Fuck!
"Vettel is losing it, man"
"Wow, as a Seb fan he really isn't doing himself any favors any more. What the fucking fuck."
"Merc 1,2

Vettel spinning

Classic f1 things"
[deleted]
such a dumb move from a veteran
"""NOTED"" (that Sebastian was trying way too hard and is throwing away what little chances he has this season)"
"Vettel locked up before he even hit Sainz, must've done a poor job of getting temperatures into the tyres."
Hamilton complained. My last box. BINGOO!
"LET THEM RACE

LET THEM RACE

LET THEM RACE"
Oh my god  this is such a terrible race.
"""we'll be turning the engines down, it's only fair"""
Vettel spins again!
"Grosjean cutting corners, still third-last."
I will cum if the mercs take each other out.
Vettel dive bomb was just embarassing
Vet united with Rai
"Question: when they have the time gaps are they how far they are behind the next driver or the first place driver? 

Right now I see each number is higher than the last so it looks to me like time out from first place. But earlier I thought I saw some fluctuations like the seventh place driver had +4, eighth was +2, ninth was +6 so that felt like it was time out from the next driver, but there doesn't seem to be any label saying what the time means.

Edit: thanks for the answers everyone! Never had so many responses to a comment before. :) 

What I learned: if it says “leader” by the first place driver then the times by each driver are how far out of first place. If it says “interval” then each time is how far they are from the driver directly in front of them. 

So I was on the right track, just wasn’t sure how to tell between the two other than guessing the guys at the end of the pack weren’t each 30~ seconds out from each other since they’d be lapped numerous times by that point haha."
Latifi will be finishing the race by tomorrow
Hamilton’s deciding which turn they’re both going to go off the track at. Any bets ?
Do we need to wait for Mclaren PR to send the pit lane footage to the Stewards before they investigate this unsafe release?
"chassis default 2-1, multi 21??"
Multi 2-1?
Can I just say that Toto looks incredibly silly with the face shield
"""But hes using more kerb than me"", something a child would say"
We may turn up next week to Latifi still finishing this week's race at this rate.
Ohhhhhh boyyysss. I'm about to nut hearing its critical issues
3 laps with only Merc? Come on
Norris gonna get a podium
"Don’t listen to them, go full on the curbs I’m sure it will be fine, trust me I want the best for you..."
Wow. Mercedes robs us of a race. Just turn it off now.
Charles is likely driving that car to the limit so in reality it’s slower than both McLaren’s
Pls have both mercs DNF and albin gets his first race win!
"Grosjean back at it again. If Romain were a horse, they'd take it out back and shoot it"
For Grosjean's said I hope his breaks are gone lol
Pinnacle of engineering but cant produce an engine that runs 71 laps.
Russell sacrificed himself for the sake of the racing.  What a hero.
If Albon or Perez snatches a win or even 2nd after Mercedes flexing all weekend I’ll take it tbh
Gearbox failure for Mercedes and we have Checo on P1!
Gonna call it: Merc 1/2 DNF with simultaneous gearbox failures
Oh what the hell his wheel just took off
why did he decide he needed to come back on the track with 3 wheels
Never seen that before
I thought the tyres were supposed to be tethered to the cars...
Perez going to keep that place?
The rim is still attached. The tire flew off
This is the first time I've seen Safety Car going through the pit lane
"Lafiti will make point, and to think people were shitting on him! He driving slow because he knows he doesn't need to go fast, just managing the car!"
Why are they driving through the pits?
I bloody love Austria man
Pierre in seventh place. Very smooth and mature driving so far. He can be proud of this.
"No but honestly, what's happening? Australia doesn't have this many retirements when it's the first race usually."
[tfw seeing Ferrari struggling](https://i.imgur.com/davPCwu.gif)
YESSSSSS ALEX GOT THE PLACE
"Oh boy, interviews with masks are super muffled. I’m sure that won’t be frustrating for the rest of the season."
What's the point in the safety car now?
LMAO
YOU'RE KIDDING
Thats on lewis....
Goddamn it Alex had a chance to win
Poor from a vet like HAM
Hamiliton is such a bad loser
Albon shouldn't try to fight Hamilton after this
IF ALBON SACRIFICED HIMSELF TO FUCK LEWIS UP TO GER LANDO ON THE PODIUM???
"Fucking Lewis, so annoyed for Albon who was clearly faster, Lewis had no chance of holding onto that position being on a harder tire with DRS not even activated."
Ok seriously. What does Hamilton have against Albon?
"cmon mercs crash each other out, get the ferrari on the podium for complete memes."
I'm sick of Brundle having different opinions of similar incidents depending on whether its a driver he likes more than others. Max or Lewis he would have said they were in front so other persons fault
Albon on suicide watch......and Lewis probably has extra security lol
This was Albons time to shine and Lewis wrecked it
"Ferrari fastest lap, which year is this ? :O"
Max last year was just as aggressive and didn’t penalise
LECLERC BALLS OF STEEL
Ham 5 sec penalty justified
BOT LEC PER PODIUM
+5 FOR HAM OOO THIS GON BE GUD
So now Bottas let's Lewis get ahead to about 4 second distance for Merc 1-2
5 seconds??? Outrageous
Ruining someone else’s race should warrant more than 5 seconds
Desperate for a Perez podium. LET’S GO!!!!
Time penalties for offenses are the worst thing ever. Especially for drivers in cars that can easily make up 5 seconds in five laps. It's just a BS get out of jail for free card for Mercedes.
Merc fuck themselves from a 1-2 by holding station instead of racing.
Holy fuck best debut F1 races ever seen
"Shit man, Latifi so close to a point!"
Leclerc looking like 2012 Alonso
I was so focused on Lando getting on the podium that I completely forgot he was driving a fucking McLaren.
"Pole, lead every lap, win the race, just missed fastest lap. Great control from Bottas!"
Well done spielberg!
"Random question - if two cars finish their penultimate lap less than 5s apart, but the leader is between them so the second of the two cars is then finished (-1 lap) but the first carries on, and the first of the two cars has a 5s penalty... does it stay in front because it got to go and finish one more lap?"
"The guy speaking to the drivers is not wearing his mask properly

edit: not the guy hosting interviews"
[deleted]
top 3 are all the people who particiapted in Virtual GP... just sayin
"Did they say lando went through a divorce? Wut?


Ok thanks guys I get it"
Shame for Sebastian today man but hopefully he comes back stronger next week.
Good race by Bottas and really exciting finish but I'm just super disappointed that we didn't get to see Albon pushing for 1st
having to endure that boring early to middle part is all worth it. glad i did not stop watching.
That was the best F1 racing I’ve seen
"Whas a great race. Was worth all the wait.

Charles and Lando P2 ans 3 is awesome. But Merc still by far the fastest team sadly."
Fucking ace race guys truly the best sport.
"Valterri! It is James, please stay off the curb and hand over the win to Lewis!"
"To quote, Fernando: ""Karma"""
"Absolutely Hamiltons fault, albon was clearly ahead"
WTF 5 SECONDS ONLY
"I'm also not sure what Hamilton could have done, he didn't change his steering angle at all...."
Why couldn't that have been one of the Mercs??
🎵 you spin my car right round right round 🎵
Vettel with the spin. F1 is really back!
What a STUPID move.  It'll be hard to support Seb after this bullshit
Lewis the f*ker
Lewis must really hate Albon
"That’s not Lewis’ fault, look at his wheel he can’t do anymore."
Pity vote for Albon DOTY was easily Norris
Red Bull karma
I cannot watch another season of this.
Race was over after turn 1 in the first lap.
wouldn’t be f1 without grosjean fucking up
Lmao welcome back grosjean. Great improvement on not taking out anyone else
What a shit show
The first race of the season and disappointing already....2020 is cursed indeed
"Same shit every year, he's not the same guy anymore"
"We can see why Mercedes is so dominant, they don't make silly mistakes or have car issues usually"
Seb doing Seb things
LETS GO HAMILTON
Hamilton is just a god for races like this he shows why he is wc. I see him.winning this
"Tell you what, the MPH graphic sucks, you don’t know which one to look at. Really hope they fuck it off"
"""Do not miss these last 20 laps"" - Lets be fucking real though, nothing will happen of interest and Merc's will finish 1-2 with Hamilton winning."
Mercedes dnf please
Isn't that 100% Hamilton fault
Hamilton’s fault
Hamilton piece of shit
"Seems like a racing incident, but albon was quite far ahead"
Hamilton take that!
Lewis swap with bottas and bottas slow the field then haha
Why the fuck is ferrari using some 2004 webcam as the fucking onboard cam.
Leclerc what a legend
I’d love a safety car finish for Lewis to finish last hahaha
Leclerc's drive is very impressive but overshadowed by Lando's first podium
The last time Austria resembled Germany this much they were being run by the Nazis
"Fucking Hamilton, dirty fucker..."
"I'm sorry but this isnt a sport anymore 

It's ridiculous how far ahead Mercedes are, and it's not because the drivers are that good."

Brilliant! Albon should've been there though fuck Hamilton
We are on!
Lets go!!!!!!!
HERE WE GO BOYS
"First race of the season, lets go!"
HYPEEEE
Finally here Boys! And with the spiciest starting grid in a long time!
its hammertime
Hoping for a great show by McClaren!!
Let’s fucking goo!!!
Why was Hamilton penalized?
We are always skeptical about our own performance.
Is interview a Mercedes ad
"I’m feeling 2019 aus Grand Prix valtteri bottas vibes, with complete domination"
"Rooting for Bottas today,"
Toto king of low balling
Let's go I've been starving for this!
The shots with the planes is so peaceful
"Reckon;

VER, HAM, BOT"
I’m so excited I’m going to burst.
"welcome back everybody, let's have some F1 fun bois"
Just two of the most powerful men in the automotive industry chilling 😎
I'm so happy we're finally racing again.
It's strange how no grid walk makes the rhythm of the pre-race seem strange.
"Got a feeling this is going to be a classic race, perfect grid line up"
Is there no commentary right now?
"Hi!! Hope you enjoy the race! Just wanted to say, F1TV is the most pathetic, sad, disgusting piece of internet membership site and I hope everyone involved in it's development and maintenance burn slowly in hell."
I just want to see that the podium is not BOT/HAM/VER (in any order). Hopefully someone from outside those three can break through.
Has the helicopter already found spectators in the mountains?
Can't even have live timing on the F1 Website. This is a fucking joke.
Safety car for 15 laps just for everyone to recall what they are doing here
Valtteri's helmet looks so pretty
"For anyone's F1 stream that is not working, try the ESPN stream. ESPN has it live."
"F1TV is working on my phone but no luck with the browser or TV, always garbage at the start of seasons."
"Go look for everybody, and one point to George Russell in that beautiful Williams."
Bottas' little Fin flag visor tear-offs are a nice touch to his helmet.
***HYPE MUSIC***
"ITS FINALLY RACE DAY

And I even managed to wake up on time"
HYPE INTRO MUSIC
INTRO HYPE
So glad F1TV isn't an option here for watching the races. Sucks for those having issues. Hope it's sorted by race start.
WE ARE HERE
"And I was just about to ask how to fix F1TV failing to acquire entitlements (whatever the fuck that means).

Seems I'm not the only one"
Sunday morning racing is amazing 🇺🇸
LETS FUCKING GO
112 days... Jesus
LETS GOOOO
Such a great feeling to have racing back. Inject Crofty “LIGHTS OUT AND AWAY WE GO” into my veins please.

"Since there are Problems with F1TV: If you have a VPN , connect to a Server in Austria and watch the Race Here with german commentary https://sport.orf.at/stories/3064362/"
So happy that F1 is back Full of nerves nothing beats the start of a race Hoping for some good battles
ooh that intro gave me goosebumps.
I so want an Albon win today!
I never knew how much I needed a James Bond movie starring Kimi until now
lets fucking go!
"When ESPN has a better streaming service, you know you fucked up."
tbh the background racing effects during the theme song makes the whole thing sound like shit
Longest wait between races in F1 history 😓THE WAIT IS OVER PEOPLE
"Damn, costs 25€ per month here."
That shot of Valterri on the intro 👌👌👌
I’ve missed you so much F1. Welcome back!
GET ME HYPE CROFTY
"Based on all the other ""first races back"" expect a snoozer

Only really F2 race 1 was any good"
[removed]
Guess I'll have to wait for the highlights. Thanks F1TV!
First time ever watching an F1 race... Seems like a solid starting point.
"Oh god, I missed that intro so much, finally getting it again!"
IM SO FUCKING EXCITED
Don't actually think the grid penalty is gonna be good for the race it'll just mean Bottas can pull away without a fight.
Track graphics are still from F1 97’ on PS1
Vamos Checo!
Perez lookin 60 years old with that stance
Come on lando let’s go
"my pre-race formation lap anxiety is back, oh how I've missed feeling nervous"
The backdrop of this race is next level
Woohoo let's go boys. This race just got potentially very interesting with Lewis on P5. Wonder if Lando can get his first podium today.
"For once im glad i have pay tv for F1, idk how they have fucked it up this bad for the lads using f1TV did they not predict it?"
Haas alongside each other...that always goes well!
Hopefully Merc go Soft to medium and the tyres don’t last
"Post your podium prediction.
VER
BOT
PER"
So how many are out by lap 1? 3/4?
"A race is on, I have the app loaded and I'm looking for a shady stream. Formula 1 is truly back!"
Bruhhh why is Bottas standing like that
Lets go!!
Big oof for Kimi
Good morning everyone. So glad to be back with all of you. Ready to complain about boring races and how dominant Mercs are for another year.
Seeing both drivers in the top 10 makes me happy already
thir...5th Crofty is back
Another Ferrari without a drink smh
itshappenning.gif
I missed that music.. it's good to be back!
GOD I MISSED THIS VAMOS LANDO NORRIS
"This is good, have not had some Merc win in a while!"
good to see they did not ask ocon to make that seductive picture like his 2018 grid photo of him half taking off his race suit
Really hoping Russell has a good race. Also a Racing Point or McLaren podium would be ace please!
Waited a while for this. Good luck Lando!
Fine message about COVID.
It’s happening!
FINALLY WE ARE RACING!!
"I have missed you all, it’s been too long"
Hopefully George russell can overtake Haas
"They cover tires up? I’m new, I apologize, I’ve never seen that in any other Motorsport"
I'm so excited even though Seb won't do jack shit.
Bring back the chaos!
Ah that famous phrase “rusty as crazy”
Love how they brought back the 2005 cockpit cam
LANDOOO
LETS FUCKIN GOOOOOO
"Everyone else’s grid photo: 😐

Russell’s: 😁"
Yo where are people finding streams? /r/motorsportsstreams is dead
"Bottas and Norris in the starting 3? Hell yeah brother. 

In before Lewis finishes in first."
I’M SHAKING!
Little finnish flags onBottas helmet are dope
"Grosjean, Latifi, Magnussen bottom 3."
It's really good to see f1 again
"It's been too long.

LET'S GOOOOO!"
holy cow im hyped
This is EXCITING!!!!!
Haha Valterri wasted no time
Im so erect
I hope that the race is safe 🙏🏼🙏🏼
Let’s fucking go boys
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Oh boy am I excited for this!
Is Bottas doing the formation lap super fast so Max cant get any heat into the tyre?
Oh shit here come the first lap nerves.
Love seeing that orange and blue in P3!
GOOOO LANDOOOOOOO!!!!
Bottas for the win.
"Oh fuck, here we go lads"
Boogity boogity boogity lets go racing boys
We're back baby! Landon to send it t1.
#HERE WE GO
lets go formula 1 we finally waited for so long
I am so fucking excited
anyone else gonna start an edging session?
I'm afraid of surgeon Toto.
Bot with a great start!
Bottas gone already
And Bottas is gone
Its been too long!!
Ohmygodohmygod
Bottas already way ahead lmao
Bottas getting away easily
"Great win for Bottas, congratulations, etc. etc."
HOLY FUCK IM SO EXCITED
Toto is already scowling. Best of luck Lando.
Perez mega!
Checoooo!!
Well.. and there goes Bottas! See ya..
oh no that car is fucking fast
This race might already be won LUL
Go on Lando!
Ferrari battling with the wrong Mercedes
Both racing points fuming already
Of course George is down to P19.
Bottas a rocket
Another formation lap lol
Man Lando is quick
Valtteri go boy go
Damn both racing points like a chimney in the turns
"Albon: ""thats for Brazil, Lewis"""
BOIS SAINZ IS GETTING AIR TIME HOKY FRICK
"Merc flying away.. on a better tyre, but still."
[deleted]
Nice clean start. We have a race!
Both RP have some oil
mclarens looking real racy
Bruh. Bottas flew
[deleted]
RP doing a lot of smoking.
Bottas has a great gap
Racing Points puffing oil all over the place
Fuck me 3 seconds already
Hamilton trying to take Albon. Vietnam flashbacks
"Bye, Bye Bottas"
Damage on Hamiltons car?
Are you fucking kidding me. ESPN just shit the bed on me lmao
Damn good fight there between Norris and Verstappen
Both RP’s smokin on every turn
How good is not seeing 3 or 4 cars drive off and everyone stay bunched up
Bottas running away faster than my dad did
And Bottas is gone
Don't see how Bottas can screw this one up 2 second gap already
At least the 'midfield' battle will be good
Perez leclerc battle has been great already
I'm so glad that Ocon is back.
Good god. Bottas could sandbag now and still win.
"“P1 Valterri, P1”"
Racing Points looking like steam locomotives.
Bottas is so far ahead. Pack it up boys
My god that gap to Bottas already
"Holy cow, Bottas has just sodded off"
It's nice to see Ferrari fighting someone
Probably safe to go ahead and queue up that Finnish national anthem.
Both RPs having engine issues?
How do you open up a gap that large after one lap? Bloody hell Mercedes
"Jesus christ 2.5 secs in 2laps

Talk about domination"
Wtfff Bottas is gone
Lando has a problem???
Bottas 2.5 seconds up after 1 lap.  Guess this'll be a midfield race.
GG Bottas
Fck Russel is 19th!
Bottas is so fast. Holy cow
Albon podium today please
Norris is doing some decent defending considering who he has behind him
Bottas running away in this race
Ferrari can't compete with Racing Point...
Red Bull looking stronger then I thought
Can you hear the team radio messages?
Man Hamilton on albon and Leclerc on Perez were fucking awesome to watch
I'm going to get through this season by just pretending Mercedes doesn't exist.
where can i see the live timing apart from the official website?
Bottas has a 2.5 gap from Max already...
Ferrari looks so damn slow.
Excellent Alex
Brilliant start by Giovinazzi
"Ferrari vs McLaren, we're back to normal!"
Mcl what’s happening 😭
Oh damn that was clean from Albon
What tires is verstappen on?
"I am having a hard time differentiating between the Alpha Tauri's, Alfa Romeo and Williams..."
"Yes, Alex! Get in!"
Let’s go BOTTAS 3.0!!
"did you guy miss the ""is light out..."""
Lewis sets the purple
So with drs enabled Mercedes and red bull get a much bigger advantage.
Cmon Albon keep Hamilton behind
So where's the rain machine?
"Wait I leave for 30 seconds and Lando drops from 3rd to 5th, what happened?"
Landoo:(
Anybody getting audio but not video with F1 TV?
¸Norris droping.
"Bold move, Alex! I'm impressed he's not afraid to rub elbows with Lewis.

Norris running in a lonely P3, Max in P2."
Mclaren is going to be lethal with a Merc engine
Alex is doing an amazing job. So proud of him.
"Stroll doing well, about a second ahead of Seb"
"Disappointing opening laps from Norris and McLaren, hopefully not an indication of race pace."
V E R S T H A P P E N I N G
"'Redbull 2 and Redbull 3, here at the Redbull ring'"
Renault race pace does not look good.
The Alfa Romeos are doing great. In fact Ferrari engine teams doing better than I thought (except for Ferrari that is).
"Wow, Ferrari is very bad."
this should be a live discussion
Gees. Lewis gets close to those kerbs.
I think they mentioned Ric twice in the past hour :(
Albon still fast with the old wing.
How many race start replays are we going to have...
"Damn, Norris is driving in mud, just cant keep up"
What happened to Lando? My stream glitched out and he suddenly fell down to P5.
Did crofty just pronounce alpha tauri correctly? My word.
Last time Albon had Hamilton chasing him it did not go well.
Perez smoking again?
I’m getting Brazil 2019 flashbacks from Albon and Hamilton fighting for 3rd
Gosh I remember a few months ago joking about the Tauri name and all the stargate jokes and now just....none of that seems important.
Even with a comfortable lead Bot not about to let Ham have the fastest lap.
Did albon and ham touch?
Vettel actually on some good pace rn
Imagine the stress of having Hamilton behind you !
Bottas just chilling
That Mercedes behind Red Bull looks like stealthy ninja.
"Could always get revenge on Hamilton, Albon..."
Everybody's smoking today....:o
lewis is like a cop at the end of the month following a speeding albon
"""Bono, my tires..."""
Are my eyes just a year older or is it harder to see if DRS is open on this year's cars?
Must be terrifying seeing that black Mercedes in your mirrors.
I feel bad for the Williams boys.
Wow the Austrian GP was great this year
That was easy for Hamilton
Did Albon even have a throttle pedal there?
No!
"Wow I keep getting error codes trying to watch the race on F1 TV. Fucking works before but not when it matters, thank you F1 very good app"
"Wait, the season started and Vettel doesn't have a 2021 deal for a seat?"
Lando can maybe get a podium the way Gasly did
He just walked past him there
The Merc is definitely quicker so far.
Nice defending there alex but uh...
"Nice, soon it will be Merc 1-2 unless Verstappen has a defensive masterclass"
That camera angle made me feel things
When did he do that?
Both RPs are gonna break during this race. I guarantee it.
This is perfect for Max. Keep Lewis busy with Alex and get free attack.
Are the remaining races for Vettel going to be like auditioning for a seat?
So bloody easy from Hamilton
"Classic RTL, adds right when Hamilton is going for the overtake. They litteraly vut from the frame of Hams driver cam to the add. What a joke"
Noooooo Alex 😪😪😪
Damm ferrari
And we never saw how kvyat’s passed 2 cars
"This is embarrassing, even for Ferrari haha"
Lol Renault pushing Ferrari.
It's painful seeing Ferrari like this
VERSTAPPEN NO NO NO
Nooo Max
Noooooo for fucks sake why?????
Take DRS away from Mercedes please.
Finale after 10 Laps F1TV is working :)
Honda has arrived.
OOOOOOOFFFF
Ok so the Pink Mercedes is fast and the Ferarri is actually slow...
"Newbie here, Come someone tell me what’s up with ferrari, started following f1 last season, and ferrari seems even worse than last season."
Fuck Verstappen noo
Noooooooooooooo
oh fuck max no
Oh fuck dead race now
Ferrari not even the best at the Midfield this is a shocker
Nooooo MAX OUT
"I'm so livid F1TV is down the race isn't enjoyable. Truly, fuck these guys."
No!
The fact neither Ferrari has moved from their starting grid speaks volumes
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Wow what the fuck
God fucking damnit.
Leclerc cant even catch up to Perez.
FUCK !!!!!!
WHAAAAT
RIPPPPPP
RIP
Oh shit!
"Ah yes, Mercedes 1-2"
FUCK FUCK FUCK
Angry Max
"The more things change, the more they stay the same………"
Nooooooo Max
Max's car matters /s
"And there goes the first race, awesome..."
"There we go, Red Bull doing Red Bull things."
Yup that sounds unhealthy
Fuck
bold prediction but maybe no points for ferrari?
RB reliability issues? Nature has returned.
I wish i knew what was happening and not in commercial right now
my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
bye omg
Red bull dead :(
Ouch
RIP this race
"ffs it's going to be Mercedes 1-2 again, isn't it?"
Merc 1-2 confirmed
WOAH I GOT AN AD AND MAX IS 17
"Racing Point disappointed that they are stuck in 6th and 9th?

Well, the Mercedes' weakness is dirty air..."
NOOOOO
Albon podium hype
Why!!!!!!!
OOOOFFF MAX
Honda power
God damn it
Max pushed the wrong button..
F
For fucks sake
Vtec kicked in yo!
Leclerc and Vettel are championship level drivers the car they have is an absolute joke
"Ok, time to turn off the TV."
Fuck this shit
At least the Williams aren't finishing last.
Nice from red bull
race over
WTF! Noooooooo!
FUCK SAKE
"Well RIP this race, congrats Mercedes"
Cue F1 recorder theme song
"eh, that was anticlimactic-"
"WTF Max, what is going on?"
Well boys the Merc 1-2 is in
MAX NOOOO
NOOOOOOOOOO
There goes all the hype for the race
Oh no
So much for honda reliability
Damn that’s crazy it just completely died
Ah thats a travesty
Oof Verstappen
NOOOOOOO MAX WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED
"Oh no, this is terrible"
Holy shit what is this
"Holy shit, poor Max"
NO MAX
Some things never change.
What a pity
"And just like that, Mercedes 1-2."
Fucks sake
5 more cars to drop out so Ferrari can win! Let's goooo
Welp
Williams ahead of redbull lul ezzzz
Mercedes 1-2 GG
Should I even continue watching this race?
"Run from it, dread it, Mercedes 1-2 still arrives all the same"
 #Blessed
So glad we don't have a full season.
"Well, now I understand what does it feel to follow a midfield team with Sky"
"Dread it, run from it. 

The Mercedes 1-2 still arrives"
"Is it 2022 yet, IV somehow be ok with 5 years of merc, but I don't want 2 more years"
Only 12 laps for the season to be over lmao
"Russell ahead of Verstappen, Williams resurgence?"
bRiNg bAcK fUckInG v12'S
Williams infront of a RB!
Honda issue?
At least Norris is in P4 now
"Ok boys, race is over"
Has any other driver ever had as many power failures as Max? Jesus.
Fuuuck sake
Well that was fun while it lasted
"1st race, 11 lap and season is definitely over!!!"
"Anti-Stall, hey I've seen this one"
GeT iN tH3re LeWis
FUCKKKKKKKK
You gotta wonder what the other teams have actually done while Mercedes was working
nooooooooo
"In the end, Mercedes will always be 1-2"
"Max: Change to setting xyz

Car: Rejected"
Car 33 dead
Max needs Task Manager - End Task
that looks bumpy and rought to be in the cockpit
Redbull wtf did you just do
Poor Max. Very unlucky
Super Max MaX MAX SUPER Max c'mon fight...
Albon podium???
That Honda still sounds like sex even when it’s limping 😭
Windows has crashed
You can feel the frustration from the team.
That sweet sweet anti-stall 😖
Max is out.
Even I as a Ham fan I’m gutted.
What??????
This is fucking sad for Max. Cmon! 112 days to retire like this. Fuck man!
DAMIT😭
Does Albon has the same engine or was it just aero where he doesn't have the upgrades?
GG Mercedes :(
Alex / Lando / Sergio podium fight?
Alright Albion podium!
Rip max :(
The power of dreams!
Is live timing down for y'all too?
"OH NO, OH GOD, MAX."
Vettels mediums kicking in
Mercedes 1-2 confirmed
[deleted]
F
Lol what is this
Time for bed?
F
"I want norris for 3rd ,imagine a Redditor on F1 podium"
"Now, will Hamilton close up to Bottas"
HOW UNFORTUNATE
Ted mic is definitely linked to the play driver radio button
Well my eyes are all on the midfield now!
Albon podium though... it's something.
"I want to see Max get out of the car, then Hulk flip it over in frustration."
Hamilton slowly closing the gap
Well fack...
Albon podium oh yeah.
The race for third is on!
Albono podium though!
"Terrible luck for Max, but this puts Danny back into the points. :)"
That is fucking brutal.
Oof. There goes the last hope of fighting the Empire.
lando finally pulling out perez
At least ferrari aren't having cars retire
Lewis slowly coming back to valtteri
rip verstappen
So much for an exciting race then.
"Must be so hard for max, it looked so good for him and albon. Now it’s up to albon to get some points for Red Bull"
LATIFI P19!
didn't even have the decency to make em throw a yellow flag or something...
Max in Austria 2020 be like Hamilton in Germany 2019 but worse.
Can they give Albon the new front wing now?
[deleted]
Did they just push Max's car into Alex's garage?
furious young Dutchman
"Sucks for RBR, but damn am I enjoying this stroll, vettle, Ricciardo battle!!!"
Silver lining is that it makes it slightly more likely for a Norris podium
If there’s a yellow Hamilton is going to win
At least Williams aren't last !
We need Bottas to spin out like he has in the past to make this race interesting
"He is still listed as ""in pit"" lmao."
This is good for McLaren atleast
Still a long way to go in the race.  Bot and Ham will definitely be wheel-to-wheel for the win for Race 1.
As a NASCAR fan coming over to watch this I'm enjoying this race. Though if happened in NASCAR most fan would most likely hate this race
Come on Albon grab that podium!
I hope Albon makes it to the podium at least.
I legit forgot about Ferrari's existence in this race
Orange Pink Red Orange Pink Red
Lando v Albon for podium tho hopefully
"Its weird how no flags were thrown for a very slow car on the track. I thought there will be a VSC, but not even yellow flags were shown."
Vettel with DRS is just falling further behind Stroll this is just sad
"""We can fight the mercedes"" lol"
Ric breathing down Vet neck.... Where have I heard that before?
TV missed Sainz overtake on Stroll.
Engine power for Stroll... uh oh.
Stroll with engine issues too lol
PSA: F1TV is back ppl.
Stroll with no power and still looks no slower than the Ferrari lol
I wonder what the odds would’ve been on the sports books for Verstappen being the first retiree this season. Would’ve never guessed it.
Is this a Honda issue?
Slightly more hype with RP engine troubles. Hopefully it's the same for all of the Merc engines
We had a good idea of who would win. Lets enjoy the rest of the field.
Lance slowing down to help the Ferraris
"Perez dropping back, trying for clean air or just can't match the pace?"
"Same shit, different year 

FFS"
Those Mercs are just sprinting away from Albon.
Needing a safety car to potentially save this race.
So has ferrari gone to plan C?
Can red bull give Albon the new wing that was on Max's car? Idk the rules for things like that.
"Local broadcaster isn't getting any team radio, not fun."
2014 Ferrari flashbacks
Only thing that'll make the WDC exciting is if Bottas pulls a Rosberg
"Hopefully lando can get a move on albon, seems to have got Perez off his gearbox (not that they’d ever fucking show us a mclaren)"
"Hamilton still closing the gap. Praying for good racing action from Mercedes, at least!"
Stroll with an engine issue and the RP is still holding Vettel off. Hungary can't come soon enough for Ferrari.
"NICE! Even less competition now that Verstapen is out. So lovely 

/s"
Its kinda sad seeing how Ferrari is so far back
perez is dropping back
So may say that’s karma for doubling down on the Hamilton penalty. It’s robbed us of a race though.
F1TV all of a sudden with the emergency player with 50fps
This season will be a cakewalk for Merc.
Is Perez having the same issue as Stroll?
"Aw, I wanted to see Ricciardo fight Vettel."
Dans gone too
Admirable to watch Vettel's valiant attempt at driving a staw rickshaw in the most frontier of all motorsports.
"Rics engine is gone as well lmao.

What the hell is going on with them today."
RICCIARDO WHY I HATE YOU RENAULT
Did somebody mention Renault's engines?
"A struggling stroll racing point is easily defending a 4 time world champ Ferrari.


Huh?"
Wtf now danny ric?
Lewis is setting purples
Fuck sake.
Oh well done Renault
Will be a shame if Stroll's engine shits itself now. His pace was looking good this weekend.
Not a good day for everyone’s favourite F1 buddy duo....
Nooooooo Ricciardo :(((((((((((
And another sacrifice to the reliability gods
DANNY PLS
Normal service resumes for Williams after all :/
Whelp.
Danny NOOOIOOOOO
> When a Racing Point with power issues is faster on the straights than  the Ferrari
Danny just wants to hang out with his buddy Max.
Renault gotta be Renault... fuck
"Ferrari are so shit they are unable to pass Stroll in a last years Mercedes, running with a power issue. That's just sad. Amazing, but sad."
RIC having problems too?
Rice going down rip
HELLO DARKNESS MY OLD FRIEND. WE'VE BEEN FUCKED BY RENAULT AGAIN
"Lol, Renault be like, hold my beer"
Rip Ric :(
Daniel is cursed
Typical Ricardo engine problems
PUs got rusty during the long break.
Old Red Bull team is in shambles
Engines also have viruses.
God dammit. Danny deserves better.
"*Laughter in French accent as a button labelled ""KILL"" is hurriedly covered up on the Renault pit wall*"
For fucks sake I can't handle Daniel and these fucking Renault engines cucking him year on fucking year
Aaaaand that's my 2 favourite drivers out.... fuck this season.
Ferrari spent more time on the choreography for their car reveal than on developing the car.
Some things never change...
Not Danny please
NOOOOOO!!!
Renault had too much of a break I think
Max and Ricc out. RB cursed.
F for Ricciardo :(
Ric vindication for McLaren move lmao
Bully gets Bullied
This has officially gone from bad to worse
Lol that Renault sounds like a tractor
I just celebrated Seb getting 8th place fml
GOD DAMMIT!!
Everyone gets reliability issues except Ferrari.. Hmm
So everyone other than merc and McLaren have engine problems?
Ferrari gonna get a podium place through pure luck.
"Damn, did they test the cars after hiatus? Even I had to test mine after months of quaratine..."
Ricciardo and Verstappen having cars fail on them. Welcome to 2017-2018!
This race is cursed
2020 is the worst.
These cars need some WD-40...
FUUUUUUCK. Poor Danny Ric 😰😰
"Renault probably laughing at red bull, then...."
oh no renault
Oh FFS
NOOOO
"One by One. New plot line, how many DNFs do we have today."
VER and RIC out. They took out all the fun.
So that's... three cars having issues now?
This race is turning into survival of the fittest
And their goes RIC as well. Great start to the season...
Man they are dropping like flies
All power unit problems today
He can join Verstappen for a pity party :/
Aww sonofabitch :(
Well at least Ferrari has the most reliable engine in this race
"Alright kids, the theme of today is ENGINE/GEARBOX FAILURE!"
Everyones engine is dying
Flashbacks for Danny and Max.
Great to see some good old fashioned racing: cars breaking down!
So Ferrari is the only engine not having problems so far? Well that's interesting
Turns out the great Ferrari master plan for this year is to improve engine reliability. Genius!
I feel bad for riccardo
"Renault is done, stroll is done LMAO these cars are gggg"
Max and Daniel like old times
may as well call the season finished now
"Me: If Ric was still with RBR he would've been the one to have an engine failure

Renault: I got you, fam"
"Its' not even that hot today in Austria right, hot in general but nothing out of the ordinary for summer F1 right? F2 seemed to have a lot of pretty early failures as well."
"Oh c'mon, first Max now Danny Ric, ugh."
Russell still struggling in the Williams? I missed the race up until now.
Ha
Guys I don’t wanna jinx it but I think we might actually get midfield coverage here
Fuck this shit..max ricciardo stroll..smh
So weak Mercedes engine = current Ferrari engine. Ugh.
Ricciardo with intense 2018 flashbacks
Lec catching Perez
Ferrari on podium after every car retires other  than Mercedes retires
"Who's gonna be the next having a mechanical issue? Do your bets, people, do your bets!!!"
Stroll’s fucked as well
Danny. Nooo
[deleted]
Goddamn stroll’s car is SLOW rn
ALBON?!?
Gasly ahead of Stroll now.
F1 TV is an absolute joke today... I finally managed to get the onboard I wanted and the data screen and suddenly it changed back to the main feed and I could no longer select any other stream.
"They keep saying ""the heat of Austria"" so I looked it up, and it's apparently 83*F, which surely isn't enough to cause this many heat-related issues, right?"
When’s the last time Mercedes had a DNF because of engine problems? I literally can’t remember.
This'll be so Boring race from now until The end lol
"Two favourites out so soon, what a fucking waste"
What is it with all these issues... We wanted an exciting race alright!
"These engines can’t handle the heat in the 1st race. We supposed to build to the summer, not start in the summer."
So far Danny stands to be the only winner from driver market movements next year.
"Mercedes, Renault and Honda engines having issues? Ferrari none yet. Coincidence? INB4 Ferrari engine issue"
1:09.000 fastest lap for Hamilton.
"Does Stroll have engine troubles as well?

Edit. Well spoke to soon, he retired as well."
Renault is joke. Ocon is nowhere
Pretty terrible track for Stroll to have reduced power tbh
Bottas is getting the Hungary 2019 special from Lewis today
"I knew this race was going too well for us, fuck"
Now it's a race to see how many cars going to finish
"HELP US, VALTTERI. YOU'RE OUR ONLY HOPE!"
"How long til Stroll retires?  
Then only Ferrari has all cars in the race :D"
I hope it pisses down
Season 2020: Another tough one for RIC fans.
"Mercedes 1-2 is just a meme, r-right?"
Was wondering why Stroll had such a slow pace. Lacking power it seems.
"Reliability playing a key part isn’t great anyway, buts it’s especially unwelcome in such a short and unpredictable season"
This seems like a mid 2000’s race with all of this reliability issues.
Has Albon ever been on podium?
KMAG is secretly having a really good race so far
It looks like Ferrari engine has no quali mode but is pretty fine in race
Stroll’s out
Just Grosjean things.
Also both Alpha Tauri in the points now.
[deleted]
This is fucked
George up to P15
Latifi is not the last runner
This race gonna be a snooze fest aint it?
"Try harder Romain, this race badly needs a SC"
Romain why do you do this to me
Ricciardo can never catch a break. Just give the guy a reliable car!
Williams mopping up the rear...again. They won’t last another 2 seasons
Never change Grosjean. Never change.
hahaha he just whipped right in to the garage
If this keeps up Williams is going to be in the points.
6 more retirements until Williams points.
Goddamnit look at those interval times. Why do I even bother
"If Latifi keeps going up at the rate he is, he'll finish the race in 7th."
1 mercedes down 3 to go
The Haas looks like an F2 car from the front
"Poor racing point.

And of course Mercedes is crazy reliable."
RB Austria: Hunger Games Edition
Start as you mean to go on RoGro!
What the hell how many race DNF! It's like the cars don't want to run after the restart
Hamilton fastest lap at 1:09.00.
"OK Ocon be speedy for me, let's see at least a few points"
And RIP Stroll. What a shit race.
HAM fastest lap here we go.
They are falling thick and fast
welcome to 2020 grosjean
Stroll nooooooooo :'(
FUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
The issue with so many new fans is that whenever I ask questions on the race thread nobody answers anymore because it's not seen :(
"The more I see it, the more I really love that BWT pink livery."
Thanks Grosjean for atleast trying to make it slightly interesting.
Are we being Punk’d?
22 laps in and already 3 dnfs
Grosjean has been Ericsson'd
I feel like I'm watching another F2 races with all of these mechanical retirements
Lewis cutting into bottas’s lead very quickly
And another one bites the dust... and another one...
SPEEN
Grosjean is Maldonadoing it up
Lewis has made up 2.5 seconds since taking over 2nd
Ferrari playing 4d chess here.  Make car slower/more reliable knowing everybody (except Mercedes) will blow up.
Looks like it's been hammertime
Mercedes engine reliability will be interesting to see over the course of this season.
"Now we need a Ferrari engine problem and that makes bingo, I think"
Anyone want to bet on how many retirements we'll see? 5 doesn't seem that crazy now.
"4/10 so far, hopefully the race can improve"
“Awwwww jeeee we gonna undercut that Perez to win P5” did nobody expect them to say this year
"Guess we're not used to this new world, where cars are dropping like flies, in Austria. :("
Do you think Racing Point copied Bottas' car from Brazil?
2020 going to keep its record of no F1 races being completed at this rate.
15th and 16th is set to be one of the best Williams opening day finishes in a few years
I like racing point's fire suits
"Not trying to be mean but why is Kvyat still in F1? I don't think he's getting a red bull seat anymore, and I thought the alpha tauri was mainly for development? Are there no red bull juniors that could've been ready for that seat?"
"Rookie mistakes. Everyone knows that when you first use your car after the lockdown period you gotta get your MOT done, check your tyre pressure and warm the engine up."
double penetration world on the front wing of the Renault
ferrari will fuck up their pitstop i can feel it
"At this rate of attrition, Williams can expect a nice clean 6-7"
Ferrari plan F incoming
F1 became Battle Royale
"For all the shit, Ferrari might actually finish the race"
11 seconds ahead after 23 laps! ELEVEN SECONDS!
Ham is inevitable.
Albon and norris to podium please.
Fucking pit Giovinazzi Alfa
Grosjean is back!
Are the Mercs using the DAS?
Shoutout to Haas for not having embarrassing deg this year. KMag doing well.
Great banter ferrari
Ferrari playing 4d chess
Williams about to get lapped lol
Norris is not too far from Albon you know?
"'one of the racing points just retired, make sure to look after your car's hahhhahahahhaha"
"Ferrari playing the long con, wait for everyone to have their pu or engine die and cruise to 3/4 place"
What's this mercedes dark  magic....
"Ferrari trying to play mind games with Williams, interesting."
Is Lando lapping faster than Alex? Seems to be.
Upset that Norris is not keeping pace with Albon. Would have liked to see it.
Latifi already gonna get lapped
Another one....
###Mercedes going to lap everyone but themselves ###
Lec doesn't even have the pace against RP
Lmao what if Ferrari are trying to do the dummy pit stop Merc pulled on them last year and earlier
That Ham-Bot gap is just slowly getting smaller and smaller
"wait, that's illegal!"
How the hell is Hamilton 11 seconds clear off Albon?
Preserve that Sensor Bottas
Hard Tyres are blue?
Norris is surprisingly not dropping out of 4-5 second window
Bottas pls
Five more retirements and Williams is in the points!
"Albon standing still on the driver tracker at turn 5, scaring the hell out of me"
Martin has mentioned the vibration noise and now that's all I can hear
Max retiring. The moment the race died
Hamilton on god mode
Lewis is coming.
Bono: its hammertime
laughable how far ahead Mercedes is right now
Vettel on course to get lapped on pace.
"So this is what they felt in the 80s, that every lap any car could go? You know, I don't hate the concept, it adds a crazy unpredictability factor."
Grosjean put on Hard Wets according to the graphics
Ocons car sounds like my vacuum
Yep that Mercedes is clearly half a second faster than anything out there. Potentially 0.8 seconds or more on bigger circuits. Scary.
Has bottles got an issue ?
Hamilton tastes Finnish blood
Grosjean apparently on Pirelli’s new Hard Wet tires per the graphic. /s
Hamilton really pushing it.
Blue hards in the graphics. Interesting they still have blue colored hards in their graphics
not being able to use the curbs would change the racing line for you... no bueno.
"Fucking Haas

Perfect representation of the US."
Brakes gone? Bizzare mistake otherwise.
"I wonder if Bottas is okay, he's losing a lot of time."
"Is KMAG's front wing damaged?

[I wrote this comment before he spun]"
"Ferrari might get lapped, 40 seconds behind Bottas."
Mag lost brakes?
Wtf magnussen brake issues?
did.... did Kev forget there was a turn
Ooof
Haas LUL
Oh shit. Kevin DNF :(
Magnussen grosjean'd
Kmag lost brakes
Haas thanks for your service for a safety car
What is happening in this race. So many car issues
And another one
LMAO MAG's brakes checked out
He said “fuck it I’m done”
Haas doing Haas things i see
"Oof, K-Mag spun out.

Man, lots of retirements so far, wtf."
"Who knew that ""Mercedes 1-2"" was going to be the complete list of finishing cars."
Mags lost the brakes
"Now safety car, and Ham to overtake on the restart. 

This sport. yikes."
What the fk is that renault sound
These next 2 championships will be the easiest of Hamilton's career
Russell p13 boys!
F1TV has been so completely unusable today. I don't understand how a sport with so much money can have such a poor infrastructure for this app.
This is wild
"wtf is up with Ocon's engine, jesus"
WHAT WAS THAT
Well shit I was just going to say MAG is doing a good job..
Looks like brake issues
Did the brakes break?
Safety car
Magnuson just yeeted t5
Guenther is gonna have a heart attack
Ohh Haas...
KMag nooooo
"Lmao Bottas is actually throwing this lead away. 

I don't wanna hear anymore Bottas 3.0 talk about this guy"
KMAG saw a parking spot. Gotta rush in
HAAS are done man.
What the hell was Magnussen trying there?
"Yes safety car, please."
"Hey all, you think this race is boring, just wait until we get to watch again next week! Same track, same Mercedes beatdown"
GG Bottas!
Haas Boys like tricks ☺
GET HYPED BOYS
OCONsistency incoming
Ocon overtook Magnussen so hard that he just gave up and left the track.
So that's one car from each engine manufacturer that's retired from the race
SAFETY CAR
Wow that Renault engine sound lol
Fucking wankers
"Formula 1 Reddit hasn't skipped a beat. Everybody on suicide watch.  Welcome back, y'all :D"
Nooooo KMAG
Well this just gifted Lewis the win.
WHAT IS HAPPENING WHAT THE FUCK
Haas are horrifically bad
A few more and Russell gets a point
Dropping like flies.
A few more retirements and Williams scores points
"Haas once again saves the day, will miss em"
"Consistent race pace has always been Bottas issue. He seems to be able to live with Lewis on single lap pace, but over a race and a season he just doesnt seem to have the consistency. Early days for this season yet though I suppose."
Magnussen's car doing social distance
"Fun fact: Leclerc (+1) and Vettel (+3) have gained positions just because of retirements (VER, RIC, STR)"
Safety car!
Good to see F1 is back to normal again
The double stack is absolutely beautiful
Did anyone come with a car besides Mercedes? WTF are these gaps?
Sexy double stack alert!
Safety car! This race has it all!
Good to know that hamilton still has that monster race pace...
At least we get to see that Sexy AMG
Double stack Mercedes!
"Guys, some respect for KMag please. He sacrificed himself to give us this safety car."
rip haas next season
Esteban Ocon was lucky to not get hit by Romain Grosjean.
Magnussen’s controller disconnected
I want both Albon and Norris to get there first podium. Maybe a Merc or two could DNF?
2.8 and 2.5 double pit from Merc....were they not on a break???
Fuck this doesn’t help Seb at all
God I love watching double stacks.
"Doubble stack, yes? yes?!"
Merc just flexing with them double stack pitstops.
Stacked double stop for Mercedes there. Very well performed.
Couldnt get any easier lol
At this rate Latifi's got a shot at a podium
Did covid cause reduction of quality testing of parts or something....not a single racing incident and 4 retirements already.
Can’t even trust Bottas 2/3.0 or whatever version he is rn to do his job and set up an interesting finale.
Love a double stack.
Fucking hell McLaren nearly bottled that
"Merc double stack and done cleanly. Wow, they are really rubbing it in at this point!"
Master class
Oof unsafe release.
That double pitstop
That was surely an unsafe release from RP
Mercedes are just the most professional people I've ever seen
McLaren making work difficult for themselves
Russell P13 COME ONN
Williams going to triple last year's points in one race at the opener
"lets go lando, good chance to get albon"
Now it becomes a sprint
it's pit time bois
UNSAFE RELEASE
"What happened to Ricciardo and Magnusses, i saw only Verstappen"
Holy crap that exit was so scary
JESUS
Unsafe release
Haas pit crew with mask down. :D
What a double stack.
Pitcrashes. Something happened!
They had to do it to us
Perez gets a penalty
Stuffs happening all over the place. just nothing that stops Mercedes from dominating :(
(A)mazon (W)eb (S)hit
Double stacks on double stacks on double stacks
Nah hes good
"Yup can't do that, good on checo for taking avoiding action"
wtf was that release??
Perez mediums?
"Ooof, unsafe release for Checo?"
So VSC wasn’t an option here?
Nice unsafe release racing point
Maybe something interesting can happen at the front after this safety
Perfect double stack from Mercedes of course lol
The panicked yell I just let out for Norris is louder than my neighbours should’ve heard
"come on albon, have a dive at hamilton on the restart"
What a timing for pitting!
perez penalty?
everything is going good for hamilton to get 1st
Yep unsafe release
Gio
McLaren almost lost a position from a bad pit.
The softs seemed to be lasting forever they might be right with the mediums
Anyone have a time on that HAM pit for lap 27?
"Damn, Perez probably gonna get a penalty for that."
Almost shit myself now
"Oh yeah, Tracing Point vs McLaren fight is already getting spicy."
"Hamilton with pace, right on Bottas' ass for the restart..."
"Oof, might be a penalty for RP"
Williams is going to tortoise-and-hare their way to a top 10 finish.
Max must be seething with this Safety Car coming out.
Checo on a 2 stopper?
Let’s go Albon. You can do it!!
Another mechanical failure!? Jeez this race
watch Ferrari getting overtaken in the straights. :(
Why did the HAAS crash?
Perez on mediums is interesting.
"Yeah, I'll be very surprised if anything like this happens for next week's race."
Russel P13. Nice.
Complaining it in like usual
How many cars will finish?
Oo Lewis caught up to valteri.... let’s see
He did not!  He did not hit him!  Oh hai Martin!
The result of this race on the left side of your screen. Not even half this race done...
You can't overtake when there's a safety car. But why are drivers not trying to close the gap more while safety car is on?
"If that's what we can expect from this season, F1 shouldn't have started..."
Perez on the mediums? Odd decision
Merc 1-2-3 l. The prophecy !!!! It's true
An Albon podium and I’ll be fine with this season.
Damn that deep V8 growl from the AMG GT R
Hey Racing Point did something different with Perez...wonder how that is going to work out
Well at least if Albons on the podium it's redemption from what happened in Brazil last year.
"Hotstar shit the bed, anyone ?"
Ferrari actually might increase their position here
Kmag said there was a brake failure
Why was the Safety Car deployed instead of having a VSC?
"Barring any retirements 8th is likely the best Seb can hope for then, honestly I'm not confident he'll be able to hold the AT honestly"
Ferrari 6-7-8 let's go bois?
Can the safety car bugger off already
This safety car really fucked Sebs strategy.
Is the yellow because of mag?
"Räikkönen got so fucked by this SC, he just left pitlane when SC came on..."
"Not even an investigation for unsafe release... or do they never ""investigate"" it and go straight to a penalty?"
"Russell is back up a few places. At this rate, he'd be on for his first points."
DAS HOT
TROMBONE TIME BABAY
Why is ricciardo out? I missed it
Norris caught napping
Why is Albon not closing in more on Hamilton?
"Ted gets interrupted so much, poor guy"
poor ted
Racecar? Put a bangin' DAS on it.
Come in Bottas. Keep Lewis behind you. Then we might still have an interesting season.
The safety car was because there less marshalls on the circuit? Sure that could have been cleared with yellows last year.
OH
😂😂😂😬😬😬😬😭😭😭😂😂😂
And there it is
And Vettel spins...
THINGS NEVER CHANGE LOL
Seb once again
No no no no sebbbbbb
Vettel spinning. This is a normal season
MEIN GOTT MUSS DAS SEIN?!
"safaty car happened when lewis was recovering 0.4 / lap. lucky bottas he was still in front to change first. in this kind of moments, mercedes needs to prioritize"
Vettel lad come on...
S B in
Wooooow
You heckin dingus
VETTEL LMAOOO
Sbinella
Man. I forgot what a mess F1 can be.
There was never going to be space there Vettel.
SBIN
Spin
You can't make this shit up
Vettell loolll
Rip vettel
Oh Seb
SBIN
THIS is racing I fucking missed this
oh man  wow
"Mclaren fighting Ferrari, that takes me back"
kinda poetic lol
Spin Master
How fucking poetic I want to die
Oh FFS
All around me are familiar faces
Im spent 💦💦💦
insert memes
OH MY GOD LOL
LMAO. Are you not entertained?
RIP Vettel
Wtf was Seb doing
Love Hamilton.. but for the sake of racing.. ANYBODY BUT HAMILTON PLS!!
i am so done
Sebestian plz
MISSION SPINNOW
Sainz just dad dicked Vettel lmfao
HE DID THE THING
The jokes write themselves lmao
Vettel 🤦🏽‍♂️
It took long
bro
NO
Prepare yourselves for the memes on that spin out
Well there goes Vettel...
Hahahahahaahah
That's why he's getting replaced
Classic Seb. Lost all his race craft
Hahahhahahahaha classic vettel
The Seb Special
God damn it Vettel
Oh shit here we go
Seb wtf are you doing
Didn't take long for Seb to spin <3 already in-form
"Holy shit seb, you're done my friend"
"I’m surprised it was Vettel alone that spun, I thought it would either be both or just Sainz."
What is Vettel playing at!?
Lmao!
L o l
Jesus fuckin Christ vettel..
"JFC, Ray Charles could've seen that hole was going to close Seb."
Next year's teammates battling it out already.
Russell first F1 points???
I'm so glad Vettel failed the PIT maneuver
F1 is truly back
Banging that front axel as usual!
Vettel spin compilation + 1
LMAO VETTEL
What a meme
Calling that optimistic is in itself an optimistic take. Wtf Vettel?
And there is the sBin
Sbinala Seb
pure fucking poetry
"Ah, finally it feels like F1 is back."
"""Oh, goddamnit…""

Fair enough, Seb. Fair enough."
Nooooo Seb
MAAAAAAAATE
"nice that vettel avoided a big take out,"
Why always him.
"Vettel is done, he has lost it"
Lewis already 2 seconds past Albon WTF actually
We've got it all haven't we....
DIO CANE
I'm really happy we can get a spinning compliation of vettel in 2020 again
Of all the people to crash into...
"Hahah, you couldn't write that. Beautiful"
What a stupid move I get that he has to try to overdrive this car but that never would have worked.
Well that was painful
I’M VERY CLOSE
Oh jeez.
Whats Seb doing there lol...
FUCK SAKE. That was terrible from Seb
"It's nothing but constant disappointment for Ferrari, jeez."
I've missed this so much
oooooooh
"Oh Vet 

Sigh"
I’m done with life. Pls kill me
"Death

Taxes

Vettel Spins"
"that was overly optimistic from Vettel, racing incident imho... but bad racecraft from Vettel, unnecessary, very low probability move."
Looks like we never left
I'm sad
Lando: *flashbacks to Abu Dhabi*
"Another spin by Vettel, all is right in the world"
You spin me right round baby....
Perezzzzz
Bottas has nice pace atm
Ohh ffs norris
Valtteri really trying to get rid of that gap
Why does Vettel lock up so damn often? Maybe it's cause the cameras are on him more often but I swear he locks up at least once every race.
Russell for points a possibility?
Sainz with the power move there.
I'm just going to hope that Mercedes will have some DNFs too to make the season a little bit interesting. Or at least give us a real fight between Bottas and Lewis.
"This feels like 2014/2015 all over again. The mercs pulling 4 seconds on the rest in 3-4 Laps.

F this season."
Let’s go george
sergey perez
Perez looking strong
That turn 3 DRS zone needs to go.
Hamilton closing in on Bottas?
RIP Norris podium 😭
"Vettel still ahead of Latifi lmfaooo 

F in the comment section"
Perez should get penalised no?
Can Perez's Mediums last?
So GIO is going to crash. Now just need Ocon to retire and Russel is in points.
Russel is gonna get a point out of this Williams.
"2020 taketh, but 2020 also giveth"
:(
Vettel staying classy
"If you had told me that Williams would be above Red Bull, Ferrari and Renault today..."
Hey the 2 streaming buddies
It's nice of seb to show off his spinning skills to the midfield
I hope at least 1 alfa romeo can get into points today
This engine sound
Why does the ferrari onboard look so shit lol
Merc 1-2-3 incoming
"F1 noob here: why did the Safety car come out there? It seemed like the Haas was well clear of the track after his spin, and it didn’t look like there was any debris on the track either."
Ferrari's engines sound sorta crunchy to anyone else?
"Let’s go russell, you’re my only hope for any satisfaction out of this now"
"When I thought about battling Ferrari, this isn't what I imagined"
Can’t wait to 2022 season
This looks like 2016
Why does the Ferrari sound so subdued onboard? Can't decide if I like that or not.
Norris struggling
Does this race just prove Ferrari have no quali mode because their times in Sector 1 have been very similar to those around them
Go checo!!
McLaren may have issues heating tires up? Struggled at the start and the SC restart.
"Damn Perez damn, that was nice."
Mwhahaha Merc already tuning down
With that Ferrari pace Vettel will have a huge task just getting in the points
"Why do we think the unsafe release was ""noted""? We've seen penalties given for equal or not as bad ones?"
"Bottas was pulling away, getting to 1.35seconds but Hamilton's started pulling him back."
So Perez wasn't penalised for dangerous release?
Keep an eye on Checo. It ain’t over for Norris
Midfield battles looking good with Ferrari in the mix now!
"Feels weird, seeing Ferrari behind Racing Point and McLaren"
Does Perez have enough tyre left for the race on mediums? Or will he be struggling hard towards the end?
"Okay, let's go Perez!"
Does Mercedes use DAS during normal racing or just during safety car periods?
I reckon they’ve just turned bottas down to avoid team orders 😂
Why is Latiffi sooo far away?
Why in the fuck would Mercedes use team orders for a race they’re clearly going to 1-2?
"Don't do anything stupid, guys..."
But I want overtaking darn it
"Literally just said Bottas was showing good restart pace, but now here comes Vader"
"Oh, Haas... WTF you doin'?"
"""has he got any sweets left?"", haha"
I feel like Vettel has been having brake problems but i dont know
What do the blinking lights mean on the back of the cars?
Is Albons car a lot slower or is he just not driving as well as the mercs?
That reverse camera is sick
Nice a rear view mirror
As it stands McLaren are 2nd in the constructors championship.
That Halo Rear View is awesome!
"""Multi 21 Lewis. Multi 21""

slams monster can down"
"Nice, Ferrari halo has a rear view mirror"
Ferrari going for the revolutionary rear mirrors on the halo. Hats off to them.
Love the use of the rear view mirror. So obviously they'll never use it when there's an actual battle happening.
Why does the Ferrari onboard camera sound so far away?
Reverse camera HUD is cool
They’re actually showing Sainz instead of the front 2 I give up
At least Charles not getting DRS
Lewis in straight IDGAF mode right now.
F1 TV takes away broadcast for half the race so that we're relieved when it's back and don't complain when the audio is completely out of sync.
"Even if Ferrari get 4-5th in the constructors championship. Whats the point. Its not like they need that money.
This season absolutely serves no purpose for Ferrari. 
It just scares Sainz."
Love the rear wing view.
Where the fuck are the new AWS graphics?
Norris gapping Leclerc again
"I'm confused, are the timings on the leaderboard indicative of how far each car is from each other or how far they are from the leader?"
Whats with the variance of the onboard engine sounds? Ferrari sounds like its underwater while the Renault like a blender going off
No penalty for Racing Point unsafe release?
The problem with Seb spinning is....the Ferrari is a midfielder.
I completely forgot about ocon
Russell doing well in 12th!
with an inevitable Mercedes 1-2 and Vettel being at the back of the grid the only 2 things that could save this race for me is an Albon podium and Russel scoring points. Come on!
"I dont think I like Leclerc being called ""The Meat"""
Did Latifi spin? Shocking difference with Russell
Giovinazzi is really doing a fantastic job . He deserves more air time
#JuicyHam
Renault POV should be banned considered the sound of their engine. 🤢
F1.5 brings joy again
That Renault is sounding positively animalistic. I like it.
[deleted]
Williams desperate for an accident right now with Russell 12th.
jesus the Renault sounds horrible
Checo podium hype!!
Renault with the banshee engine.
God only took them 5 laps to shoe the battle for 1st
Renault sounding like nails on chalkboard.
Plan A hell yeah norris c'mon
Not used to seeing a Racing Point so high on the leader list.
Plan A!
How's Perez's tyre management? Gonna be tricky to keep the mediums in good condition today
"At what time does ""good"" air becomes ""bad"" air? When does the slipstream becomes dirty air?"
Hamilton's gonna win as usual.
Common BOT you got this
I'm calling it. Hamilton for the win and Albon on podium.
That Renault sounds so boss
What's with this track and sketchy team orders?
Toto is just a gift for the memers.
Come on Norris!!!!
Ooooo merc having issues
Sensor issues! Get Lando up on that podium!
Haha Toto taking no chances with the shield
Albon podium hype!!
Hamilton would surely be quicker out front if he's able to stay that close behind
Disappointed. Not surprised
How is it a guy can be an high level engineer with a position on a Formula 1 team and not know how to properly wear a damn mask?
He's gonna win again isnt he
"That gap the Mercedes have on everyone else makes me so sad. Can't even see the other cars in the shot, even on the long cuts."
sensor issues both on black and pink mercedes xD
3 Merc engines with sensor issues (Inc stroll) maybe this won't be Mercs year after all? 🤔
beautiful shot! love the trees around the track
Lewis does not fuck off. He never leaves you alone
Both Mercs gonna OUT from sensor issues.
Just can't stay off of the curbs
Man F1 throwing in everything to make it spicy
Bottas is great in the one place it matters - T3
Well he's not wrong.
"Stay on the kerbs between 5! 6! 7! 8!

There's some STORIES, that you all should KNOW...."
Lewis is taking some wide lines
DAS-trian grand prix.
"""Family saloon""


""Pushes you along nicely"""
Praying for a double engine failure for merc
This is fascinating. Bottas is clearly not listening and could fuck up his car in the process
Bottas almost entered LAWNMOWER mode
Bottas staying just enough in front
Oh George lost a place to Kimi
Mmmm full beans
Yeah the midfield is close but there's no action there either :-/
Vettel can't even gain from POS 14th. That's really telling.
Lewis with the schoolyard strats! lol
Valtteri just launches off t2
lmao Lewis
Anyone know why they aren’t using DAS?
"Meanwhile, in the Merc garage: https://i.imgur.com/O7GfM4u.png"
This feel eerily like 2015/16 where merc just goes into the sunset and we see the occasional Merc battle and everyone else is faaar behind
[deleted]
What problems are Merc having now?
Come on Bottas. Keep Lewis behind you.
At least let the Merc drivers race each other if none of the other teams can even mount a title challenge.
Wish they’d show russel
"Dictionary corner, with Martin Brundle"
Brundle reading the damn dictionary out here
At least bloody race fellas
Welp gg bottas
tWo sECoNDs tEd
Can they make the team radios quieter? Can hardly hear them
Gear box issue critical
"10 seconds down to Albon, fucking hell Mercedes.."
Keep riding the curbs
loool
This is going to be a great season
Where is Albon??
HIT ALLLL ZE CURBS!!!!
Even with the boring as fuck merc 1-2 I missed this so much and I forgot how much I love F1
Bottas and Hamilton are in the same postion for quite some time. I'd like to see some other cars racing too.
Hé James is back.
oh god the kerbs are doing their thing
"""Lewis, the kerbs is lava"""
CRITICAL!
"I like merc, but would love to see Double cat failure lololllll"
F1 has become the race for 3rd
Ocon's been running a pretty quiet and consistent race of his own up the field. Healthy +4 positions gained since Lap 1. Hopefully the Renault holds up.
critical uh oh
I fucking love Martin Brundle haha
Double merc dnf?
Pls pls let mercs retire
Battle of attrition.
BUT BUT BUT I WANNA WIN !!!!!!!!!!!!
Merc drivers are being stupid now. Could end up sacrificing one of the cars here for being so stubborn
I wonder if Merc wants their cars to drive on the kerbs. So many mixed messages.
C R I T I C AL
"You're going to lap the entire fuckin field, let them race you pussies"
"Oh no a critical issue again?!

I wonder how will they survive this race now."
We’ve been watching the Mercedes non stop for so long now
Guys please stay off the racing line
Pump a merc double retirement through my veins
Whoops. Bottas not happy
Bono my sensors are dead
Did they show Raikkonen overtake on Russell?
"It would be nice to watch some other cars for a while, we’ve seen nothing but Mercedes for the last 15 minutes."
"Imagine Albon-Perez-Norris top 3

But Bottas-Albon-Perez is the real shit"
Is there any point in watching this race until the end? Pretty cars go round vroom vroom.
If its critical how are they gonna lap 25 laps more or so..
Are the curbs in Austria much worse than anywhere else?
Bono and James putting all the pressure on their drivers
"David Croft: professional commentator, everybody"
"Albon, Perez, lando podium is something I want to see"
F1 wouldn’t be back with the obligatory shoe shot
Vettel is still behind Russell
"lol, imagine a 1-2 retirement 


https://twitter.com/mercedesamgf1/status/1279779275336568834?s=21"
Are Mercedes seriously able to just avoid all the freaking curbs and everyone else still just falls even FURTHER behind? How's that possible...
There is drifting... and then there is the radical sport of CURB'n and of course Mercedes are dominating it.
Seems like valtteri just hasn't got the race pace that Lewis does. Needs to work on that if he wants to beat him over a season
Show the fucking midfield.
curb avoidance 2020
It's always hard to figure out if they're actually having problems or if it's just Merc being dramatic
Boring boring
finally we see Vettel
"Good lord, are there any other cars to watch in this race?"
We could watch Ocon and kvyat battled rather then 2 mercs nurse their cars
The Williams improvement is really impressive. Holding off a damn Ferrari.
"With the move to bigger rims, less tire in the future these Austria kurbs will be even more deadly in the future!"
Almost 10 seconds gap between mercedes and the rest.. 20 laps to go... thats crazy
"Race is over, Sky is getting giggly"
When I wanted something to really challenge the mercs this year i didn't mean the kerbs.
Merc still gaining time against Albon with slower lines
Finally something else then mercs.
What's up with Vettel? Cant even catch up Williams or Alfa Romeo.
Mercedes car running slow and still gaining time over Albon
[Toto IRL] (https://i.imgur.com/y7I48Jo.jpg)
Ferrari vs Williams. Like. I mean. Ferrari vs Williams.
"10 seconds a lap? Come on ""Crofty"""
No one can get close to mercedes even with problems
A DOUBLE!
ah RoGro taking the scenic route
Albon still manages to be falling further behind the mercs
Lol Williams ahead of a Ferrari... this year... is nuts
"Ferrari were a fucking mess when they wouldn't win a race last year, wonder how they're taking being outdone by Williams"
this fucking broadcast only showing merc is ridiculous. thanks for the 15 minutes of boring mercedes 1-2 laps
Seb still behind Russell haha end me
"Am I seeing it right that Vettel can't even catch up to Russell?

Edit: Sorry guys, I jinxed it."
Is sensors important for car running
Grosjean going for a nice Sunday drive
Vettel struggling to close in a Williams..how the turn tables
10 seconds ahead. Closer battles in the rear of the field.... no coverage. This is like a merc test session. Whats new. F1 coverage continuing to be trash
That is not the track Romain
Vettel down with the freaking Williams' is just sad
Grosjean testing track boundaries
"lmao, switch to vettel in 14th"
Grosjean still out their defying race rules. He’s made up his own track.
"Car's supposed to go *fast*, Grosjean"
FINALLY they stop showing Mercedes after 10 minutes of non stop screen time.
Feel so sorry for Gunther
kerb chat is only slightly better than tyre chat
living meme
I can hear Steiner screaming in the garage all the way from home.
Nooooo George
Haas: the gift that keeps on giving.
Imagine saying last year that Vettel would struggle to get past Russell on pure pace lmao
Haas is in full oof mode this year
Not George!
Ah damn.
"FUCK

HUGE F"
GEORGE NO NO
NO RUSSEL
"Grosjean, taking the route Kimi took in China?"
Haas just inspecting all corners of the track.
Drive2Survive3
FUCK NO NOT RUSSELL
Russell nooo
"Oh no, Russell :("
Oh no not Russell. such a shame as he was having a good race
Grosjean 2020 Rallycross champion
NOOOOOOOOOOOO this is more crushing than Verstappen lmao
ohnooo george :(
Safety car again
Safety car!!!
Fade me fam
Grosjean track limits...
Noooo
😩😩😩😩
"Haas had brake issues during practice as well, didn't they?"
6 mechanical failures is nuts
Ummm Romain thats not the track.
Russel noooooooo
NOOOOOOOO
Fuck meeeeeeed
Oh look... Grosjean out
Grosjean having a nice drive through the medows.
Safety car again
Great place to stop Russel...
Another car out
Nooooooo Russell
Russell dead
That's going to annoy the Mercs Russell
so another Mercedes engine dead
Shake my head
Come on f1 gods make the mercs retire instead of the drivers we actually want to watch
Surely a Saftey Car
When Russel drives over a curb
"Just retire Grosjean, ffs. That car couldn't be any worse with Juan Pablo Montoya running it."
VETTEL FINALLY PASSED RUSSEL
SC
"could be a safety car, ya don't say"
Safety Car again
Safety car again.
SAFETY CAR!!!
WOOHOOO SAFETY CAR YAYAYAY
GRO and RUS retiring too
This makes things interesting...
Mercedes sensors pls
Noo George
Safety car let’s gooooo
Nooooooo George
Poor Williams
WE WERE ALL ROOTING FOR YOU GEORGE. WILLIAMS WHAT THE FUCK
These cars are super rusty
SAFETY CAR
This is what we need
NOOOOO GEORGE NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HE WAS HAVING SUCH A GOOD RACE
Medium really worked for Perez then
RUSSELL NOOOOOOO
Safety car again!
Yes SC!
Bruh how many years can you have brake issues before you question wtf the team is doing
"2020, I hate you"
Lol of course. Williams finally gets some sort of pace and only *now* do they have a mechanical failure.
Safety Car
Safety car!
RUSSELL NO
Haas are the new Williams
"Sucks for Russell, he was looking great."
Jesus Russell almost taking his teammate out too there
Brakes again for the HAAS?
Hey Seb can finally pass RUS
safety car --> albon right behind mercedes --> mercedes have to be careful --> albon wins
Russell making it interesting by parking on the grass :D
All a part of the ferrari master plan ^^TM
Come on Alex And Lando pressure those mercs
SAFETY CAR ALEX TAKE MY ENERGY
Williams sacrificing a car to make for a great finish
Good news for Albon possibly
Nooooo Glorious George
30% of the grid is out.
George noooo:(
Cmon Albon. Put some pressure on!
Safety car please!! Albon to attack!
"Bottas can't catch a break, can he?"
"Albon, Perez, please pressure out the mercs"
They are dropping like flies!
Oh no Russell :(
A weirdly high attrition rate race
AH shit here we go
Thank fuck was worrying about Perez tyres then
"Nooo, George :("
Noooooooooooo Russell!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
George had a few marshal posts/holes in the wall he could've stopped at there.
This is your moment Alex!!
Let’s go! safety car out everyone on softs!
Haas brakes bad
"Woo, entertainment ftw"
Vettel spins on a restart - calling it now
A safety car that does not benefit Mercedes? Madness I tell you
"We've got a race back on the menu lads!

Also, just a thought. There's no way this Merc gearbox can survive another full race distance next week right?"
6 mechanical failures. This takes me back.
I'd rather take Alex at P3 than have to fight off Perez with no hopes of catching Mercedes tbh
nooooooooooooo not Russell
Damn this plays out so well for Perez
Driver of the day: safety car
what is this even lmao
😢
DONT DO THAT. DONT GIVE ME HOPE.
Brake issues at Haas.
I don’t think albon has the ability to attack the Mercs
"You get to retire, you get to retire, everybody gets to retire."
Ferrari going for the Mercedes reliability.
Latifi up to 14th now!!
Oh this could be bad for Ferrari.
"Go Checo... For the sake of all F1 fans, and my Fantasy League..."
Let's go Albon
Vamos Albon!
What was that about a crocodile?
Lol they are using even more curb than they were before!
"Oh no, Mr. Steiner won't be happy about that. Wonder if that's a similar brake issue to what Kevin's experienced. 

Shame for George, he was running pretty solid in P12 for a while."
this race is very 2020 in that it's both super chaotic and kinda boring at the same time
Latifi is +28 and in 14th somehow
norris has pitted!
I have a feeling they're gonna ask Sainz to let Lando by...
ALBONO
Anybody else watch Grosjean and have flashbacks to their father yelling “I DO NOT NEED TO STOP AND GET DIRECTIONS!!!” on family vacation or is that just me???
That williams steering wheel is sexy
"Next Mercedes DNF. Race 2, restart Championship please"
Guess there was not enough time to test everything properly after the reopening of the factories.
Williams falling on the sword for the greater good
This could get juicy
This race just got a lot more interesting.
Aren't soft tires for Albon a bit risky?
Merc going to the end 👀
"14 Finishers, still no points for Vettel."
Yo wtf is this race.... 2020 is gonna be a tough year of attrition isn't it
Albon on softs? What are the odds of that will work out?
I'm loving all these safety cars
Albon to beat them on tyres? Can I dream?
Latifi might score points at this rate
"Honestly, how can Haas keep on having brake issues forever? Flintstones it at this point, it's going to work better."
Can't help but think that Merc will be a little annoyed that Russell didn't use the massive escape road at T4
"No George, oh no."
Perez in 3rd pog
Massive chance for Albon here
functional cars are overrated anyway
Merc did not pit? Lmao
Perez Albon Norris 1 2 3
"Anyone else surprised at the amount of unreliability issues ?

been a while since we seen this many mechanical dnfs"
Hard tires? BBQ chicken alert.
Perez as buffer between albon and ham?
Now this could get very interesting
Albon gonna make things spicy
Albon is gonna make this interesting
"So many comments on this live thread, says a lot about how much this community got wider, really proud of it!"
Very surprises Alex went soft instead of medium here.
"Albon on softs, Mercs staying out!"
Racing point ruin their race. WHYYY
Where does Rosbergs lisp suddenly come from?
Albon win incoming fuck yes.
Come on albon channel your own ricciardo china 2018
Russel is our lord and savior. Him and evil curb
If this is the situation in the first race.... I won't be surprised if a car just straight up falls apart
[deleted]
"This race feels like Austin with the ""be careful over there cause the car will break"" think they'll do anything about the kerbs?"
"Am I the only one that thinks the Mercedes problems are just over hyped? They'll be fine, they always are..."
Hopefully Albon doesn’t get held up by Perez that much.
Win for Racing point??
Albon to win!
wtf mclaren???
War of attrition
Wonder if the mercs are afraid the gearbox issue might doom them if they try to pit?
This is juicy. Albon or Perez could be a new race winner of both Mercedes have issues.
Let’s go Albon!
Incoming Perez double overtake on the Mercs
ALBON WITH THE SOFTIES
Gigachad move by Red Bull
"Merc 1,2 & 3 potentially"
Come on Alex! Full beans!
Haas are farcical. Team needs a complete overhaul from the top down and to stop suckling on the teet of Ferrari's assistance. An embarrassment to get so much help and still be so useless after all these years.
"Mclaren fucked up for Sainz, they should have pitted him earlier :/"
Could Perez have a realistic chance of winning
Will soft last nearly 20 laps?
Vettel got softs. Hope he gets into points.
Interesting end of the race this could be
"Geez, they really are rusty!"
"If a Racing Point wins, this may be the best season off the jump."
did perez get any penalties for unsafe release?
Woo...can Albon do something here
I don't understand the strategy with Sainz to be honest
Why are Mclaren going for M. Others going on S. They think they won’t last?
Why did Mercedes not pit I'm confused?
Surprised they didn’t pit a merc
I don't actually get why Perez didn't pit?
Let's goooooo Albon
Let's go Norris!
Merc shit the bed here
Is there anything more iconic than Ted being interrupted by literally anything
The fans are multiplying in the spot from yesterday
Come on Albon.. Save RBR. P1!
Well *they* don't look like they're social distancing
"Dammit, Streisand effect strikes again"
Imagine if Latifi got a point before Russell
Well this shit just got really interesting
trying to make drama out of nothing. easy 1 and 2 for merc...
"We could make a race, just cars lapping and the last to break wins the constructors"
 im ready to be either so happy or so dissapointed
This could be box office.
Merc team orders for sure soon. Lewis is much faster and in a better functioning car. They're not giving up a win
Man.. Vettel on 13
Hahahaha that crowd
Time to shine Albon! Remember Brasil last year!
Sergio my friend...
I missed this so much
This could be a fun finish now thankfully
What are the downsides to Mercedes pittiing? Trying to understand why they didn't as a new watcher.
Come on Bottas! Keep him behind
Albon full power pls
"""Worth a punt"" Literally?"
"Albon on softs, let's goooo."
Albon make my day pls
Go anyone but Mercedes!
Cmon Alex!!
Albon FULL POWER
"Why didn't they Pit my boi??? It doesn't matter, we about to witness greatness."
"If Albon wins this, Albon 2021 confirmed."
This is like watching 20th century F1 with all the reliability problems
"Oh man, if Perez or Norris somehow win and break the seven-year Merc/Ferrari/Red Bull streak..."
"WE GO

AGAIN!"
HERE WE GO
PER ALB NOR for the podium! 123
Another yellow?
Thought I would miss the fans more. This is a good compromise.
Everyone getting excited and Mercedes are probably going to pull 1s within 3 corners lmao
"Albon and Norris on fresh tyres, whilst all the three cars in front are Mercedes with issues, and Leclerc behind.

After all the virtual racing I don't think there'd be a more popular podium than albon, norris and Leclerc."
2nd through 8th is seven different teams.
Come on Esteban
Bottas was really good on those restarts
"Why didn't Perez pit, really bad idea"
NO KIMI
Nooo kimii
"Safety car is getting a ton of action in this race, lmao."
Brroooooo
Oh no kimi
MASSIVE COCKBLOCK
What is happening?
WHAT A COCKTEASE
"""Massive crash"" lol, his wheels come off dude."
DOES ANYBODY WANT TO FINISH THIS RACE!
"This race is a fucking clusterfuck, dear god almighty 😂😂😂"
Please F1 gods blow 1 of the Merc engines
bruh
What the fuck
The SC race
What a race
I don’t know what to think anymore
SC Land :D
Tyre came off
JESUS christ MATE WTF.
These kerbs man.....those are some killer kerbs
LMFAO 1 of every car baby and Haas is just special
Guys can we talk about the fact that a Racing Point is in 3rd place?
Wow this race is getting more wild
Alex got past him before the SC right?
Raikkonen’s tyre deciding it was time to return to the Pirelli motherland.
"Ah bugger, alex already did the move, but had to give it up"
Albon so unlucky with the timing there
Raikonen kachow
"Only 13 left, 3 more and everyone will have points"
"What a shitshow, at least it's not boring"
Lol wtf his wheel just fell off
Imagine if that hit Seb jesus
Holy shit how the hell did that happen?
Cautions breed cautions.
What a race ha
This race is chaos
"Jesus Christ, SC AGAIN"
Fucking hell. Kimis luck just gets worse and worse.
Raikkonen's tire just went NOPE
Albnono has no luck
Cars are on papers today wtf
Another safety car. What happened Kimi?
That tire was dangerous af
Latifi’s gonna get a point
ALBOOONOOOO
"My god, these cars are breaking left and right"
Now that was a first
The hell was that? Suspension just self destructed
LOL
Thats was dangerous
Kimi’s front right said “aight imma head out”
What the fuck?????
What’s going on lmao
We're not gonna get this exciting end are we
Holy shit
Wheeeeeel
Will half the field finish?
kimi out :(
35% of the field is now retired from the race. This is bonkers and I love it
Sergio should give it back
No Kimi 😪😪😪
That was pretty fucking dangerous
this race is such a mess and I kinda love it
"So many DNF's. These guys forgot how to do things
 😂"
tire just wanted to be free
Bwoah
What the..
I quite like this race tbh!
This race is just crazy today
Albon in P3 coming out of the Safety Car on softs. Lets fucking go Alex
Plays into Albons hand to save the soft tires maybe?
Alfa Romeo's DAS not quite there yet
Weird way for a tyre to go out
The old wheel ejection system being deployed there
Huge fine.
Well that was an anticlimactic restart.
Latifi 2 retirements away from points... Raikkonen wheel failure
His front ^^^tyre fell off...
all the pent up drama from the season is being fully unleashed in one race its insane
Albon could make it stick this time with a couple fewer laps burning up those softs. He made it look easy at turn 3
"It's official: more DNFs than the
2019 German GP."
That onboard is some serious /r/mypeopleneedme material.
what happened to wheel tethers?!
"it uh

it's not supposed to do that..."
wtf wheel just fucked right off for seemingly no reason. The track is eating up everyone.
That tire just peeled off like you would peel the skin of an orange.
LMFAOOOO
Cheeky from Perez tbh
What a mess this race is.....
What the bloody hell is happening with this race ????
This race is wildin lol
Are Haas using those brakes that kept failing 2/3 seasons ago
Bois gotta admit we this is way better than i imagined. Yess
So.. Everyone in points?
Kimi Raikkonen drove nearly an entire lap with a tyre that wasn't properly secured. Legend.
Both Mercedes should pit now imo
Perez should have to give that place back ..
"bye, tire


LOL"
The wheels have well and truly fallen off this race
“You never want to see a tyre do that at all!” - No shit
This race is going to be last man standing
“Yeah the front fell off” -Kimi
Points for everyone!
Another one
I don't think tires are suppose to do that ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Does this race have a finish line or is it just a last-man-standing knockout competition?
is that supposed to falloff
Red Bull will be screaming at the stewards right now.
The memes that will come out if this race
God i fucking missed this.
Yeah that must have been a pit crew mistake
Tire: Ight imma head out
man knows what hes doing
"this GP is bonkers, Vettel will probably get points too, jesus"
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Should Perez surrender that position?
This is a yoke
Latifi might end up with a point at this rate lul
Kimi's Tire: Aight imma head out this way..
Racing gods are mercedes fans i am convinced
Pit stop guys ruined Raikkonen's enjoyment of his hobby. They are in trouble
"Latifi going to get points here, calling it."
Will the stewards put perez back where he belongs?
"I'm 98% certain that pass wont stand, the SC graphic was up when they were in the corner."
So is Albon past Perez? Running order says he hasnt
when was the last time only 13 racers finished?
Bottas best nail the 50th restart today
Have Mercedes shot themselves in the foot by not pitting?
Wtf is going on
IT JUST FELL OFF HAHDOFNFKF
The tire forgot he's meant to be socially distancing
Latifi to get points with the ol' tortoise approach
What exactly had changed from last year? Is it just the lack of running?
Vettel is close to points lmao
What kind of strat Will Bottas go for this restart lol
"C'mon Albon, make it interesting!"
LATIFI NOT IN LAST
That's a lot of dnfs
"Come on Kimi, just throw the spare on"
Wait what happened with Russell?
Holy shit 7 drivers out already
Time for some ice cream Kimmi
Why didn't Mercedes pit there under the safety car?
"Vettel is now 1 position outside of the points....

Well, if this isn't crazy racing, what is?"
major deja vu for Kimi
Just walk it off Kimi
Where do Haas get their brakes from? I want to know so I can make sure never to get brakes from there
Who to retire next?
"This just hurts to watch.
Almost every car breaks"
Any bets on the next retirement?
that wheel replay o0 No tether at all
Someones gonna Bradbury their way to a win
Who's the driver of the day?
"Those hards are gonna be so cold, DAS to the rescue"
Why did the tether/rope not work?
Let's see if Perez and Albon take the fight to the Mercs
They swapped Alex and Sergio
There will be more retirements
The gravel is looking like oats to me.
Alex Albon is my driver of the day
chances that the race ends behind the safety car
What happened with Kimi’s tire falling off
I bet Lando will retire from 5th again just for extra heartbreak
"You know, if Latifi steals a point today we could see a situation like last year: Russell qualifies ahead and is faster every race, gets outscored by his teammate anyway."
Lol what's going on
At this rate the safety car will be getting points and Driver of the day.
This is going to be a great finish either way
Albon took the place back?
Bernd‘s on track to be classified for completing 90%
"Ferrari: our car may be a steaming pile of shit, but at least it hasn't broken ^^^^^yet."
Is the SC coming in this lap? Come onnnnn
They let Albon get the spot. Well now.
Gtfo safety car
What the actual fuck is this race?
COME ON ALEX SEND IT!!!!!
This is apparently a dress rehearsal for next week.
Albon engine mode 'this goes to 11' right about now
"COME ON ALBON!!! 

&#x200B;

55555555+"
"If only Max was still in. This restart would've been exciting. Come on Mercedes, kill the gearbox sensor."
LET’S GO ALEX
"Let's go Albon, you are the chosen one today."
LFG Albon
Inb4 another safety car being deployed straight after
GO ON ALBONOOOOOO
In the states having a watch party before noon for a motor race. This is awesome!
Come on albon stick for DRS
Allez Pierre 💪🏼
Pack is close together. I love this
Only 1 race in and plenty of content for new fresh memes
If Verstappen was still in this race it would be an even crazier race
Safety car driver: must go faster.
Ya know it would be pretty cool if F1 added double-file restarts
The SC are the only things keeping Mercedes from lapping the whole field.
Bottas has caught the safety car on every restart.
Albon and lewis
They’re going to have to change the tires on the safety car if there are any more issues.
Albonnoooo shit ham
NO FUCKING WAY
OH FUUUCK NOO
final 11 laps lets go

Hoping for Albon to put a lot of pressure on the ne

WHY? WE HAD A CHANCE AT SOMETHING GOOD
Fuck it all!!
It's just Brazil!
Penalty For Hamilton
Albom was first
Could've won the race ffs
"Too soon, Junior"
"Lewis Hamilton, killing Albon podiums since 2019"
"So many retirements this race, but I think Kimi's tire stands a good chance of getting a point after all is said and done. Currently 14th and gaining speed."
Latifi has led a Ferrari and a red bull this race
"NOT AGAIN, FFS HAMILTON!! Poor Albon"
Haha Albon screwed again.
Oh fuck man
Brazil 2019 flashbacks
"Lol Doesn’t have the race rxft to mess with Lewis even when the race was in his lap
For a win"
ALBON GIVING ME LIFE
NOT AGAIN NOOOOO
Go Checo!!
HOLD THE FUCK ON PEREZ HDP!
that one hurt. poor alex.
PEREZ NORRIS fight for P3 then
Alboned.
That has to be a penalty for Hamilton. Albon clearly had the line
NOOO ALBONNNNN
"FUCK NO!!!

NOT A-FUCKING-GAIN!!!"
Thats a big oof. Not Lewis' fault this time though. Albon tried to force the issue.
Ham/Albon is the new tragedy we needed
Albonnnn wtfffff
mercedes 1-2-3 confirmed
NOT AGAIN
I'm so fucking done.
I cri
LOL holy shit this race
Norris is in a great position now with fresher tires
It's it safe to say next weeks race won't be an exact copy
NOOOOOOOOOOOO
This is not fucking cool
Fuck Ferrari for letting Mercedes run away like this
Hamilton the biggest podium blocker for Albon. Painful to see.
Ok Perez... now u try
Incoming sorry from Hamilton
Not again!!!!!
That has to be a penalty. Albon was ahead
Hamilton penalty needed. Just because of Albon no other reason ofc...
Sad
Are you fucking kidding me? Poor Albon :(
So this is a first a 1-2-3 mercedes lmao
"No way they do anything to Hamilton. He dumped him, though."
"Lando, atleat you please! Podium"
"""Deja vu, I've just been in this place before"""
This race is IN-SANE!!!!
"What a race, good lord."
Hamilton's car must be a tank
"*How could this happen to meeeeee, I made my mistaaaaake*"
Come on stewards do your fucking job
"So, Mercedes's cars are clearly built out of some sort of Adamantium-Vibranium alloy. You'd think that be illegal under 2020 regulations."
This is on Hamilton
thats a penalty
What is this race and how is it possible that Mercedes ALWAYS survive the chaos ffs
Seb is back where he started so maybe this isn't so bad after all
Vettel in the points :D
It's all gone ALBON!
God dammit
Time for Lando to shine
"This is too funny haha, with Lewis again too"
Vettel now: I guess 1 point for me.
I hate this race
Well that sucks
Give a  Drivethrough pls
NO
Norris podium
Pain.
God damn it NO
Mercedes 1-2-3
GIVE HAMILTON BLACK FLAG
"If Norris holds off Leclerc then he'll probably get his first podium, in the same way Sainz got it last year in Brazil."
Brundle trying out every excuse for Hamilton.
They were side by side going into the turn. Lewis should've left room.
Alex was ahead no way that's not a penalty
"So many similar things

Vettel spinning
Hamilton spinning Albon

Nothing has changed bois"
"PEREZ TO WIN. 

COME ON YOU PINK BABE."
"Podium: Mercedes, Mercedes & Mercedes"
Hamilton penalty?
Toto right now: 😤😤😤
Man fuck lewis
Lando needs to catch Checo
"Hey, Carlos"
"blow out the gearbox 

make some room for Lando"
What. The. Actual. Fuck.
I want a NASCAR style fight between Albon and Lewis in the pits after this.
more sad bwoah noises
"It’s a close one. Ham did leave some space there, but poor fucking Albon."
Sainz race pace is something else
"Hamilton and Albon, name a worse duo"
Perez and Norris for podium
Lando Lando
Come on Lando get in there.
If you can’t race em wreck em
Ferrari getting points by just making it to the end at this point
Hamilton does *stuff* in desperation
Oh my fucking good Lewis you Muppet... Lets hope the contact damaged his car enough for a DNF
Perez snatching his podium isbt he...
Kill me.
"Wait, did Gio overtake Vettel? The fuck?"
Gio got past Vettel fucking kill me
I’m so upset man.
WHAT THE FUCK AGAINNNNNNNN!?
I like that these young guys are taking it to these veteran drivers. Unfortunate that that touch happened but I like Albon's audacious attempt.
Sainz what a lad
"Can't believe that. What a race, looking forward to next week already!"
Come on Lando!!
FORZA CHARLESSSSS
"Okay, i'm now rooting for Lando.

Twitch streamer on podium GOGO"
Leclerc go away!
Lmao that’s not Sainz ffs
Woooo
This truly is what I expected out of a race once we got started in 2020
If Lewis gets a penalty Lando podium hype!
Glad I don't have to make an official call on that
What a race
"Lando, you're our only hope!!"
"They're going to call that a racing incident, aren't they?"
I'm starting to think Lewis doesn't like Albon.
Crofty thats lando
Was this the way to get revenge for the grid penalty?
Norris just has proven that it was on Hamilton lol
13 cars left and vettel is still out of the points...
Where the hell did Leclerc come from.
"Godammit, we need a break from this, please."
Fuck yeah come on Leclrec.
Racing incident
Come on Esteban
ALBONOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
"Oh dear Albon, that's brutal"
Merc 1-2-3
'sainz'
Ok Lando has dropped to 5th so no penalty for HAM pls don’t want Leclerc to get a podium
I don't know if I like this race.
"Crofty your drunk, go home."
So Red Bull seems to be only ones able to challenge the Mercs and now they get 0 points for the race
Great move by Charles there.
If hamilton gets a 5s penalty leclerc might get a podium wtf
Sharl bangin in those laps
Hold on Sergio
[deleted]
IM NUMBER NEXT YEAR SAINZ
Could you imagine a fucking Mercedes 1-2 and a 3 place for Ferrari?
"Slow Ferrari setting the fastest lap..

&#x200B;

This is meme madness."
Ferrari podium after all would be crazy
Oh shit Charles might actually drag that heap to a podium
Ferrari fastest lap?
Ferrari could get a podium lmao
I have never been so excited and so disappointed in one corner
What happened to Ferrari no pace??
Ferrari starts to work 65 laps after start
Ferrari on podium?!!!!
The commentators are horrible at telling Lando and Carlos apart
Can we stop having a full lap on 1 fking car pls
This race just went from bad to worse for me.
I would have died for seeing a meme lord on the f1 podium :(
"Imagine if Leclerc wins, fucking imagine"
Nice driving by LEC
That new graphic is sick
So gutted for Albon and Norris
Lec making it work
"Maybe the Ferrari isn't bad, maybe it just needs ~65 laps to get fully warmed up?"
Imagine Ferrari winning this lmaoooooo
Wtf is this race
ok so now I'm rooting for a Ferrari podium
Lewis penalty!!!!
Ferrari getting a podium after all this would be hilarious.
Would love to see Norris now on the podium with all that's happened today.
OENALTY FKR HAMILTON
Charles drove a great race but still incredibly lucky to even get close to a podium
Can Charles... actually... win this race?
OMG FERRARI MASTER PLAN
OH LEWIS PENALTY
A six time WDC cant keep his line. Ye right. Hamilton ruining races even when he aint winning.
"“You think I’m just gonna sit there and let you kill me?”  

-Lewis “Daniel Cormier” Hamilton"
Holy shit Charles gonna drag the Ferrari into the podium
"Holy shit, leclerc is on some crazy shit"
LEC in P2. How the fuck has he managed that?!
HAMILTON TIME PENALTY
PENALTY FOR HAMILTON
What a pass!
"Hamilton lost 5 secs, not anymore a Merc 1-2 maybe??"
Sharl Eclair into P3!
"Guys I legit had a dream Hamilton wasn't on the podium, this penalty might be it!"
"Sainz doin a Sainz, ending up in the top places after starting off near the back of the pack"
5 sec penalty on Hamilton
Norris is choking
BALLSY leclerc
"Charlie dragging a shit car where it doesn't belong. Come on, my sweet sexy driver..."
Can LEC take 2nd?
😱
"Looks like Hamilton needs to put his foot down to retain 2nd, good job its a Ferarri behind him"
FERRARI STRIKE BACK
"I hope at least Leclerc gets a podium, it would be so bad to see 3 Mercedes cars on it lol"
Consistent but far too light
This race man
Woooo leclerc 2 would be miracle
Norris vs perez for 3rd come on.
Leclerc is driving the wheels off that car!
If Charles somehow wins this I swear to God...
Lec in 2nd fucking actually lmao
What a move lec
"Oh wow, Leclerc could stand a chance at getting 2nd!"
5 sec only is absolute bullshit
Hamilton +5
LANDO PLZ PASS CHECO
"And now, Lewis needs to get the fuck out dodge."
Wtf this is a slap on the race for ruining Albons race
Deserved pentalty
I would fucking die if Leclerc stays within 5 seconds and gets P2.
So Ferrari were sandbagging after all? Jesus Christ this escalated quickly
FERRARI MASTER PLAN
INJECT IT INTO ME
he DID THE VERSTAPPN
Justice
What the fuck is happening. This let’s go leclerc basically 2nd.
Charles talent can't be stopped despite being in a shitbox.
"That's a bullshit pen, where is he gonna go? It's not like he dived him or even tried to push him off."
LeClerc winning this race would be extremely on brand for 2020 as a whole
"Leclerc will get P2, did not see that one coming..."
This race is a fucking meme innit
"Bullshit penalty, right? Seeing how Ham kept steering right and never turned into Albon. Seemed like a racing incident to me."
5 seconds? What is this fucking clown world shit FIA. Maybe they're scared he's gonna call them racist.
"Didn’t expect that to be honest, looked like a racing incident to me"
WHAT. A. RACE.
5 second penalty for sending Albon to the back of the pack? Fuck off.
"Leclerc second in the championship standings, who would've thought after qualy"
Wow nice move Charles! Good job
Leclerc just fucking sent it
That's ridiculous
5 seconds! Laughable
Ferrari is really gonna get a P2. What the hell is this race?!?!
CHARLITOOOOOOOO
CHARLES SWEET SHIT MY FUCKIN BOYYYYY
Fucking Ferrari getting 2nd place like we all thought at the start lmao
So Ferrari were sandbagging after all!
"Amazing overtake by Leclerc!

(Totally not biased here lol)"
Good
THIS RACE HAS EVERYTHING
KARMA
I fucking love Charles
Is the only way for Ferrari to get a podium this season going to be if everyone else crashes?
What a crazy race
HOLY SHIT WHAT A LUNGE
Poor Albon loses out again after Lewis gets another penalty...
Come on Sergio push hard mate
"Ah fuck, work together boys! A podium is at stake!"
Leclerc pushing this shit car to 2nd is some real Alonso shit.
Scopami Charles
Lmaooo forza Ferrari
Ham getting penalized twice in one race
"Ham with penalty, if robottas cocks it up sharl could win this thing. 2020 is just... What the fuck man"
C'mon Lando.. get perez
Get the Mercs Charles
Perez/Norris podium? What the hell is this race
Well this certainly is the kind of drama we’ve all been missing during the lockdown and living up to the hype.
FERRARI MASTER PLAN
Norris cmon you can catch Perez!!!
leglerg installed the 2019 patch vroom vroom
Merc you gotta crank that engine up
"Prediction: 
Bottas gearbox problem. Leclerc, Perez and Lando on podium"
Charles dotd!!!
Holy moly if I need to wait another 5(?) months for another race like this...I wouldn’t. But I’d wait maybe 1 month
Leclerc with Alonso levels of shitbox carrying wow
5 second penalty still gives Checo a chance at the podium!
Banana suit in P2 possibly?
"LeClerc is an incredible driving talent, taking advantage of all this luck. Brutal for Perez"
Ferrari rises like a phoenix (Konchita Wurst vibes in Austria)
Albon has overtaken Vettel..
"Hamilton fastest lap, what a surprise."
please norris and sainz don’t fuck up
McLaren are gonna lose 2 positions to Hamilton if they keep fighting
ham about to get first placed and put 5se4c on everybody.......
"Well shit, now Hamilton has to create a gap with borderline gearbox and harder tyres."
I stopped watching around 30 laps. How the fuck is leclrec up at 3rd
"When Hamilton gets penalties for hitting Albon, I say yes"
Well at least they covered the penalty before the end of the race this time
"And just like that, with a time penalty, Lewis no longer has gearbox issues...surprise, surprise!"
"God's sake Mclarens are making me NERVOUS

All this race needs now is them taking each other out :("
McLaren boys can we stop racing each other pls
Lec dragging that shitbox to 2nd
five seconds is a yoke!
5 second penalty for Perez - speeding in the pit lane.
5 seconds is very soft should’ve been more
Man he should've gotten at least a god damn drive through. 5 seconds is nothing.
Brundle needs to take Ham's cock out of his mouth it's crazy sometimes
"Lewis ""Two penalties, one race"" Hamilton"
NORRIS PODIUM LADS IT'S HAPPENING
Pierre is doing such a good job this race
Hahaha what the fuck is this race Perez penalty now
OH NO
5s is a yoke
Norris Podium ahahahhaha
YOu marvelous bastards did it...
Lolol this race
FUCK WHAT PEREZ WHAT WHAT FUCK
PUSH LANDO PUSH!!
This race is unbelievable
The fuck!
Wow how did Vettel manage not to spin Albon as he was being overtaken. Miracle! Lewis could never.
LANDO ON THE PODIUM?
NORRIS TOP 3 FUCK YEAH
This is anarchy
"Should be a 10 second penalty, he keeps doing it"
NORRIS MY BOY GET IT
Leclerc literally with all of Ferrari on his back
Norris podium my boy!!
"5 sec penalty, you gotta be kidding me"
So glad F1 is back
Italy needs to make Charles the Pope after his performance today 👌🏼👌🏼
Lewis has really got to push
ALBON SLOWING DOWN WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON
EVERYTHING IS BURNING LMAO
Fucking Red Bull!!
Oh fuck sake Lewis still gonna get a podium
THE RACE IS ON
"omfg Norris 5.3 gap to Ham.. 

of he gains 3 tenths hes P3"
Wtf is going on
Poor Albon
Leclerc channelling his inner Alonso and dragging that shit to a podium
His wheel is 90° all the way through
come on lando this is it
What a disaster
"What a joke... That was albons fault, if there not enough room, I lift or drive more to the side, doesn't he have eyes or what?"
WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING?!?!?!?!?!
"I hope they consistently start giving out penalties this year, last season it was getting stupid what they could get away with. Though i suspect people will be a lot more upset when it's not a Merc."
LANDO GIVE IT EVERYTHING!
"5 sec penalty for Lewis.

Lewis: Fastest Lap."
This race man
Norris Podium please love for the love of god
His wheel is 90° all the way through
NOTRIS PODIUM HYPE
Albon out wtf
GO ON LANDO MY SON
"Norris and Perez clouting each other.

Albon radio - My engine.... Stopping."
LETS GO LANDO
Fucking Sharls make me yours
Why are we just now hearing about the Perez penalty?
FIA: You get a penalty! You get a penalty! You get a penalty! EVERYONE GETS PENALTIES!
"Well fuck, I'm lost now."
"Feels kinda unfair towards Hamilton imo, like what else was he supposed to do? Turn right even more?"
Ok so hear me out. What if all cars have mechanical failure and end the car early
ARE YOU KIDDING ME
POG LANDO PODIUM
PEREZ LUL
Ahahaha what is this race
WHAT IS HAPPENING
They fo got this is not simracing.
😂😂😂😂 what a fucking race
Hamilton will stumble to third probably
Wait did Norris just overtake under a yellow
Norris penalty inbound
I wonder if Lewis will try and fight harder with Notts now despite the gearbox issue
That 5s for Perez came out of nowhere lmao
Albon cheekily parking up for a safety car and getting the field closed up for the end to knock Lewis off the podium.
Norris on the podium??
What the fuck penalty is that and where from?! We didn’t even know he was under investigation.....
Lots of bullet points for this race.
Everybody gets a penalty lmao
RAH EVEN AFTER LOCKDOWN THIS PANDEMIC IS STILL MESSING EVERYTHING UP
Perez :(
Ughhh safety car finish anti climax
"one more sbin and a classic torpedo, and the latifi masterplan will come together"
Come on Norris!
God I have the missed this absolute shit show that is Formula 1. I wouldn’t want it any other way.
FERRARI IN THE POINTS AND NORRIS ON THE PODIUM AND SEVEN OR EIGHT DNFS
When you get the same penalty for speeding in the pit lane as crashing and causing someone's race.
What even is this race?
If Mercedes have any sense they’ll tell Bottas to Hamilton past in light of a 5 second penalty.
MIA
Lando !!!
What is Vettel doing!?
"I still think that was harsh, Hamilton is going to be pissed"
What even is this?!?! Is this F1 now?? This race is just insanity
I still dont know what the hell is happening in this race
Come on Norris close that gap to Hamilton
"Although I don't mind seeing Lewis off of the podium, I'm not sure about ""causing a collission"". But it sure makes it a more interesting race!"
Oprah's in the Stewards team!
Holy shit what a shit show 😂
ANOTHER CAR !!!
Holy shit. 9 DNFs
RIP Perez
This is crazy. This is bloody crazy.
WTF IS THIS RACE!!
I was told there would be no math.
Everyone has gone full rword.
Send it
What even is this race?
Come on Lando close up!
219 days waiting was well worth it boys and girls
Latifi point?
LANDO TAKE MY ENERGY
"Feel bad for Perez, he actually ran a solid race only for it to fall apart in the final laps."
Double Mclaren podium possible *-*
This has to be a dry race record for DNFs right?
Bottas should let Hamilton through and block Leclerc
What the fuck is going on? Yoooo
"WHAT IS HAPPENING. 

everyone who finishes is going to get points at this rate."
BRO THIS FUCKING RACE
Jesus christ wtf is this race!!!
NORRISSSS TAKE MY ENERGYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Bottas DO NOT LET LEWIS PAST
Poor guy Latifi. Imagine being the only one not getting a point..
9 cars out. WTF?
ok race gods
This feels like a pre season match in football. Everyone and everything is just rusty.
YOU CAN SHOW REPLAYS AFTER THE RACE
"Holy shit this is CHAOS

Fuck I missed F1"
What in the world is going on here?  Am I still dreaming?
Dude this fuckin race
Hamilton still gonna be on podium because of Perez lmao
The torpedo!!!!
5s penalty has no purpose.
Latifi coming up huge
Yes Lando lad!
What in the hell is this race???!!!!!!
MEME RACE
All that shit housing from Red Bull and they get a double DNF
I have a bet on Norris to podium. Intense. Lol
Latifi P11!
Seb into points. Truly a underdog story.
Latifi points hype?
CMON LATIFI GET  THAT POINT
What the hell is happening?! This is chaos!
What even is this!?
This Race is Bonkers!!
cmon lando
Only 1 dnf left for Latifi to get points in his first race for williams...
WHAT IS THIS RACE
LATIFI IS ONE PLACE FROMPOINTS
What are we watching? What is going on?
Shoutout to the RP strategy department btw for throwing away Checo's podium by not pitting him during the SC
KVYAT NOOOOOOOOO
9 retirements and Williams might still walk away without a point.
This is bizzare
Omg if Lat gets 10th...
WHAT IS THIS RACE OH MY GOD
This is Hunger Games: F1 Edition
Craziest race that I have seen in a long while.
So lucky safety car kills the ham
Vettels worst race of his career by far imo
Papa Latifi must be playing with voodoo dolls right now to get his son into the points
Christ it's all happening.
Pushed him off track and it's fine?
So many retirements! What is this the 90s!?
Not a good weekend for Honda
Honda has hondad
One more out and latiff gets points
Austrian GP is DJ Khaled confirmed.
Absolute lmfao
"All Latifi has to do in finish in front of one person, lol"
Latifi so close to points on debut
What a race! Meine goodness!
WHAT IS GOING ON!?
What the fuck is this race?!
This race has been... something else
"20 men enter, 1 man leave"
This race perfectly sums up 2020 so far.
WTF is this fucking race....
One more retirement and the whole finishing grid gets points.
what the fuck is up with this race
@ alphamaxnova1. Your time buddy
What a crazy season start holy!
C L O W N F I E S T A
This would have been a perfect race for George to get some points.
What the fuck is happening
Latifi finishing 11th wtf
"C'mon, Norris podium please"
This race turned out way more fun than I thought. After Max retired I thought it would be boring as all hell!
good lord this is insane
So everyone finishing in points?
Jesus what an ending. If Latifi scores points my brain is going to melt.
They won't even let Vettel sabotage his final year with some dignity. How is he supposed to go zero for the season when they're pushing him into the points?
russell punching the air rn

INCREDIBLE WHAT A TURNAROUND
LETS GO LANDO!!
poor albon
NORRIIIIIIIS
I need a drink
REDDITOR ON A F1 PODIUM DAMN BOIS!!
Couldn't be happier for Lando.
Lando is going to cry!!
2 surprise podiums. Happy for the midfield teams McLaren and Ferrari.
"It takes a lot for me to not be depressed after a bad Seb race, but this race done it!!!"
I'm so happy for lando but I can't believe how albon is rn
That was awesome.
"Fuck yeah Lando, full credit to him and McLaren. Fastest lap as well for good measure"
"I’m shaking, so so happy for Lando LETS GOOOOO"
My hands hurt from clapping so hard
PLUS FASTEST LAP
"I was trashing Ferrari a bit, but unreal race from Leclerc"
High budget CGI there
Both McLaren's ahead of the tracing points on track is just icing on the cake
Nothing like a bit of mayhem and chaos!
BUMP THE 3
NORRIS!!!!!
Rightly all the plaudits to Lando. But let's not underestimate the mighty job Leclerc did to get second.
"Bravo Lando!
Latifi almost got in the points on debut because of that madness!"
LANDO!
Landooooooo
So fucking happy for Lando
What an absolute shit show of a race. Damn I’ve missed F1
i voted Valtteri for Driver of the day tbh
LANDOOOOO!!!!
last 20 laps had it all
Imagine if latifi gets Williams highest finish of the year while still finishing last in the race
Lando-bot kicked in at the last lap!!!!
LETS FUCKING GO AHHHHH
YYYYEEEESSSSSDS
LETS DO IT AGAIN NEXT WEEK!!!!!!!
Beautiful podium there
LANDOOOOO
Everyone memeing Ferrari. Doubt crushed
what a fucking race this is! I LOOOVE THIS GAME HAHHAHA
Great race chaps! See you next time.
Is this Brazil 2019 all over again?
Lessssgooooooo
Where's the little trolleys from yesterday lol bottas on the floor
"Really feisty at the end, great race."
Lando Bot
Ferrari redemption arc incoming???
"Who wouldve thought, playing games does have its rewards"
LANDOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!! GET INNNNNN!!!
"This race, what a meme"
Wow. What a race. I'm half glad we'll get a chance to rerun it next weekend.
What a race. Im speechless
I know us crowd don't like marshalling and safety cars but it did bring on the drama .
no champagne?
worth the wait
weird place for the podium
FLYING FINNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!
Is there anything that’s going to be different for next weeks race?
Vettel should just retire from the sport.
F\*CK RACE DIRECTORS THEY  DONT SHOW BOTTAS HAM WTF HONESTLY
This one is on Hamilton (again)
I hate Perez.
If Latifi gets a point I’ll genuinely be angry. He’s fucking shit and doesn’t deserve anything close to the points.
[deleted]
Thats karma if I've ever seen it
Let’s go Lewis ✊🏾
Hamilton's luck strikes again
Why is Brundle trying to justify an unsafe release
"Ah yes, the result of Vettel racing for himself and giving no fucks

LOL"
Just feels like Lewis is waiting to be told go past
Please let there be problems in both mercs 😂
"New fan here:

Why can’t he just grab another tire? They put out dozens of them all over the track just in case."
That's on Hamilton imo
KARMA HAMILTON KARMA!!!!
Fuck this season.
"This is on Lewis, didnt leave enough width"
"4.8 Lewis, get down of the podium! GG Lando!"
[deleted]
And boredom kicks in. Holy hell.
There goes this being a good Grand Prix.
VER must have tried to pull his steering wheel forward
"Man, fuck Ferrari. They are legitimately the Arsenal of F1. Big name, inconsistent results and mostly a shadow of their former selves."
Please please let both mercs crash so we cab have both Norris and Albon on podium
"Please god Merc engines go boom. 
Lando Sainz- 1-2. Perez 3."
"If Hamilton wins this now, is there even a point to watch this season?"
Latifi up 4 places in his first race. Future world champion right there
Lando podium hype!!
I wish perez gets a podium
"For someone who talks for a living, Crofty is surprisingly bad at it."
I need a Mercedes 1-3. Come on Pérez!
"What a blessing, or is this just manufactured drama?"
"Jesus what a snooze fest this.

They're focused well on the Mercedes cars when the only scope of action is the midfield"
"Mercedes have actually played themselves now. 
* Fucked up their cars
* HaHa wE gO fASt WEee
* Safety Car
* Hamilton starts moaning ""THeY dIdNt TElL mE NoT to Go On ThE CurBs

Edit: I can't format, keeps changing sorry for my bad joke"
Didn’t take Magnussen has someone who’ll have taken the knee . Respect just went up
"FFFFF ALBON. FFFF REDBULL. 

Hamilton crushing Albon's podium dreams."
bLesSeD
Hopefully an dnf now for Hamilton
What an awful awful race.
That is a penalty
Fucking HAM man
How can he not know which McLaren that is ffs?
Right 5sec penalty and Albon misses another podium. Fucking Lewis.
Well-deserved penalty. Surprised FIA actually levied it.
EAT SLUGS LEWIS
"thats why Vettel doesn't get offer from Ferrari.

sure, replace Bottas with Vettel."
SO MANY YELLOW FLAGS THIS IS TURNING INTO NASCAR
"couldn't be happier about that outcome, absolutely didn't want to see Xerox Racing Point on the podium"
Lewis is a 6 time world champion. Dont hold your words back ffs. Im sure he could take it
Hamilton with the takeout. Dirty racer strikes again.
"Merc radio right now: ""Valterri, slow down, let Lewis pass please."""
fuck hamilton
That's such a bullshit penalty. Hamilton still will come out ahead of Alex.
"Although I feel so sorry for Alex, hearing a Christian Horner depressed is nice"
"I don’t understand the argument that Mercedes didn’t just openly share intellectual property with Tracing Point. 

Everything the same and suffering from the exact same issues. It’s a carbon copy and if that’s not illegal it’s at the very least incredibly fucking unethical. I don’t like it one bit, this sport is about ingenuity.

Edit: how would we feel if every years STR/ AT was the last seasons Redbull"
Bot & Ham crash plz
Lewis has nowhere to go there
Worst driver of the day - Lewis and Vettel. Well done Lando and Leclerc!! Just a shame Albon wasn't up there.
Daimler ceo uh oh. Don't leave the support mate
"So did no one in F1 notice that the “E” in their font looks like a “2?”

“2nd Racism”"
Anyone know of Netflix is filming??
having anxiety attack already kshdjskakskskss
Does F1 TV show only delayed races?  Never live?
Perez is bloody great
NOOO LANDO NOOO
"""You're allowed to run wide in the first lap""

is that a rule or something"
Williams is even worse than last year...
"Oh wow, Lewis' car just farted as well."
This sucks for Verstappen but could this be a chance at a podium for Norris??
honda engine has decided to kneel
"HONDA POWER
.
.
.
the power of dreams"
did max just fat finger the wrong setting?
Lmao
Red bull again. How do they avoid criticism like Ferrari get?? Seriously what a joke. Letting merc walk away with it
BuT wHaT aBoUt ThE MeRc CoOlInG ISsUes
Oh no it’s bwoken!
"Wooooow Leclerc into the top 6, much worse than before, amazing"
THEY CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS
F1 was better when it wasn't on at all. This shit isn't worth watching.
Hey Albon got his front wing back
13 laps. Shortest F1 race ever.
"Reminder we don't know that this is honda's fault yet, sounds like they could start the engine so may not be a mechanical failure"
"This is my first time ever watching F1, does that happen regularly?"
I want to see Ricky Ricardo pull a cheeky overtake on fettle while they're bottled up behind stroll
"Stroll with a engine problem, still holding off Vettel."
I'm wondering if Ferrari has more power in that engine but they want to see how reliable it is and then bump up the power in Hungary.
Inb4 Ferrari is the only car without technical problems and they somehow come 3rd and 4th
Bottas is gone
Ferrari going to win the race by having the only engine without enough power to explode
Please F1 god let something exciting happening. Its been to long to be punished with a race like this
Stroll with a problem- gasly past him now
Ocon is overrated.
"This Renault, swallow ya whole, little shakin', little tenderisin', and down ya go."
Ferrari been reading Aesop's fables over the break.
Haha Grosjean. Typical
Can the disease be contracted by engines?
Max's Honda and Ric's Renault got dat COVID
"The year Ricciardo has even *decent* luck he's going to dominate the field.

Poor guy."
Could really use a safety car right about now!!!
Fucking Grosjean
"That was comedy - everybody just assuming that Grosjean had done the same as Bottas yesterday, it cuts to a replay and he's going backwards."
That's a clear cut penalty for ferari for faking their pitstop
Jesus Christ. Do something bottas. He’s just shaved 3 seconds. Use fast mode or something.
haas looking like fucking vankers
Haas being haas
"HAAS, more like HAAD amirite"
"Haas putting a late bid in for ""worst team"" despite everyone Else's troubles"""
Please be a penalty
It's so sad I'm rooting for Bottas now to give Lewis a run for his money.. Max his chances of winning the championship now with 0 points are completely nil
DAS HOT TYRES NOW
SBINALA!
I so understand Ferrari for ditching vettel
SBINOTTO
"Can we call that move ""The Vettel"" already ?"
Sebs is now the torpedo...
Someone fire up the Vettel spin compilation!
Ferrari: Do you see?
Vettel's Fault yeah?
Vetttel and Sainz incident - no investigation necessary
"George russell in front of vettel, never thought I'd see that day"
Perez will fall away come the end
That spin was oddly very Vettel
S P I N N A T I M U S P R I M E
"Vettel, when you were told to deliver your car to Sainz, we didn't mean in the middle of the race."
Have they given latifi last years car?
Seems like Valtteri does the same shit everytime. Tries to hard to build a gap but it seems he overheats his tires at the same time
Let them fight please
Is Russell a driving god or is Latifi just so bad?
Go Perez go!! P3 chance
Merc would be dumb to stop Lewis from fighting for the win.
I’ll have to get a new 400” tv to see the new halo rear camera screen they’re on about 😂
"Damn, virtual mirror now, that's great"
Sainz should be able to pass Leclerc
"Vettel doesnt like care anymore at all, with how Ferrari handled the whole contract thing and the car is, well fucking shit. Shame that his career will end like this."
Toto wearing the face shield was the funniest thing I've ever seen
Ocon is showing nothing at the moment am missing the Hulk
Mercedes doesn't even concerned about engine cooling problem they had last year. How can a team doing thing so good and properly.
Let's go Bottas! 🇫🇮
So annoying after gaining and gaining and the holding at 0.5 for ages that Ham has to drop back.
"Wouldn't mind an Albon victory, please let the critical issues be actually critical."
Stay ON the curbs fellas
This race is a shitshow
Shame about that instruction from the Merc pits about the curbs. Essentially formation racing now.
oh man this makes max's retirement hurt even more. I wonder how they could've dealt with avoiding all the kerbs if a red bull was a little closer. Can Alex make 10 seconds back in 20 laps?
"Honestly, if they just removed all Merc coverage, the race would seem absolutely cracking."
Grosjean is such a meme
Nothing will stop Grosjean from crashing
Grojean just wants to be a rally driver
What a fucking shitshow
Could Perez win this??!
Not a checco fan but I’d be thrilled to see him take out both mercs
Watch Mercedes' gearbox issue be magically resolved
oh wtf
Lewis getting a bit of his own medicine
RIP ALBON
BWOAH
"Wtf was that, the wheel could have hit Vettel in the face?!?!"
"It's okay, everyone, Kimi's car is now out of the environment."
Some say Kimi’s wheel is still rolling to this day.
What is it with 1st races of the season being a total trainwreck?
"Atleast one lap without SC, please."
Need Norris to attack my boy Albon so Perez ends 1st when the mercedes finally blow up!
It looked to me like the tire came off the wheel. Wouldn’t that be on Pirelli?
"C’mon Seb, grab a point!"
When was the last time only 13 racers finished?
Damn man how does a tire just come off like that
Yo Perez should give that position back to Albon
Yo how did albon take that place? Safety car
Another fucking round???
Come on merc gear boxes. We need you to blow soon.
They nearly cunted the safety car lmao
wtf hamilton!!!!
Oh Albon
Albon jeez that's weak
Fuck Lewis
Albon is cursed when overtaking Hamilton!
Who was at fault for that? no driver bias please Im new to this
hamilton is such a bully
Hamilton fault imo
Fucking Hamilton again
Albon was ahead
Fuck Hamilton man
I'm what world was that albons fault?
Lewis left him no room and Alex was ahead
"Sorry Hammy, you fucked up."
Vettel would get absolutely slaughtered had he done what Hamilton did
"Same thing as last time for Albon. Lewis deserves a penalty, he didn't leave enough space."
Vettel still not in the points 🧐
Can we make sure the penalty is sorted before the end of the race
"Albon needed to be patient, Mercedes are having issues so there was no rush. Could of won the race. Shame."
Imagine if albon waited a little bit... he could’ve gotten him with drs
5 seconds for ham let’s gooooo
Man I hate Mercedes
5 sec penalty finalyyyy
Get fucked Hamilton.
"Charles is dragging this piece of shit to the podium through hook or crook.

and i don't care if it took two safety cars to do it"
+5 for dropping someone 10 positions LMAO lenient af
People still think Vettel is better than Leclerc
Rip Lewis's race lol
Sky in shambles trying to explain why it's never Lewis' fault.
Unpopular opinion. Hamilton doesn't deserve that. Racing incident imo.
Who would have predicted this much spice after lap 30?
Come on give us a dead Merc too
"Guys, this is my first time watching F1. Is this race normal"
Yes yes yes yes
LANDO P3 LET'S GO
So happy with McLaren's performance and that they both passed Perez!
today is the birth of the F1 racer Lando Norris. He is no longer the goofy kid in F1 we used to see. The fight for positions and not giving up an inch for a second. Exciting stuff. Cant wait to see Mclaren back in their glory
I can’t breathe omg
"Ferraris are Red  
Red Bulls are Blue  
Albon retired  
Mercedes One ~~Two~~ ~~Three~~ Four"
[deleted]
Oi maamme Suomi synnyinmaa...
[deleted]
Awkward...lol
Any other LGBTQ+ fans here absolutely thrilled with the pride flag on McLaren?
Alex trying to play big balls with Hamilton. Doesn't matter if ham gets the penalty when your at the back of the grid and you need to learn that sooner rather than later.
"They should make Mercedes champions already, while your at it give them 2021 too. So boring."
Lewis stop complaining
"100% albon just clipping Lewis there, Lewis was on full lock"
Anything less then a drive trough for Lewis would be bullshit
"TAKE THAT HAMILTON


WOOOOOOOO"
What does Brundle mean speaking of unsafe release - They had to do it????????
People still have the nerve to say Vettel is elite
Vettel unable to even get near 13th. Lol
They're just gonna protect Mercedes by having the safety lap go on for another 5 or 6 laps
[removed]
"Hamilton turned into him, time for Red Bull to complain again"
Hahahahahahahah Lewis gets a 5 s penalty
lewis should have got 10s penalty :( oh god i hate him..
"Fuck Hamilton, once again he screwed over Albon. 5 sec penalty for that, WTF? 10 sec at least"
who's the girl off to the left side of LeClerc?
"racism is over, we did it reddit!"
[deleted]
"I swear to god

Formula 1 is fucking cursed with Mercedes

Fucking WHORESHIT"
"Lewis is already full lock side-by-side. Not really much more he can do there as Alex comes round the side.

100% racing incident for me and I feel that would’ve been the call had the same thing happened earlier in the race.

Feel for Alex man. He’s absolutely gutted."
Hamilton's wheel to wheel racing is so fucking overrated
"HAHAHAHAHA

BRING ME THE TEARS OF CHRISTIAN HORNER"
Im getting sick of this sport being so boring now
[deleted]
That should be stop go penalty. That’s bullshit.
Is Vettel in Ferrari one of the biggest dissapointment in F1's history?
Race is over guys. Save yourself time.
Race incident imo.
That was all on Hamilton.
"Shit happens, Lewis was still miles quicker than Bottas today at one of Bottas' favourite tracks so I'm optimistic for the rest of the season"
"First time betting on F1, let’s go Max!"
"I was told that Ferrari engines smoking was 100% proof of cheating, but now when Mercedes engines are smoking?"
FOR FUCKS SAKE
Bring Albon in and put Max in his car?
Fuck. Man this season already sucks. Merc 1 & 2 confirmed
"And Riccardo done too. 

Sport is pretty much dead to me. Catch ya's next year gang."
#BanMercedes
Strolls car not doing so well :/
"Excellent driver Romain Grosjean in last, can't believe HAAS haven't replaced him yet. A complete liability."
"So, I put ""ricciardo replacement"" into Google as I'd heard rumours that he might be replaced for Hungary.    


Google's reply - Fernando Alonso. Just a picture of Fernando Alonso."
"Latifi 3 seconds behind George...He some booty.  

EDIT: it’s 7 seconds not 3 didn’t notice it was interval."
"Why would we need a safety car for that?  

Edit: got it, make sense. Thanks!"
"Ferrari is the Volvo of the formula 1.

Not really sporty but very reliable, mostly liked by old people."
"It's killing me that Max would have gone to softs now, surrounded by cars on mediums"
That has to be a penalty for RP
We couldn't have imagined an easier season for Mercedes I guess. Fucking competition out of the window.
"Ahhhh fucking hell Sebastian getting screwed by his replacement 💀

E; yikes no, that was Seb’s fault"
How is it possible Latifi to have lost so much time? How any of you defend him is way beyond me.
"Not a good look Seb, not a good look. Not much of a birthday present."
"I started watching with expectation... I have just given up already as it's all to familiar...like it's so boring once again. Merc one two, Hamilton will will and that'll be that."
"Fucking Safe car, ruining Norris race"
Haas drivers are a joke tbh
"Mercedes is not even racing, there just cruising. So depressing to see them 1-2 without even trying"
"New season, same Seb. #smh"
Sounds like Multi 21
Lmao Bottas 3.0 lasted all of 43 laps.
"Hey Valtteri, It’s James. Lewis is faster than you. I repeat Lewis is faster than you. Can you confirm? 

😂😂"
#BRING THOSE FUCKING CARS HOME GODDAMNIT
Mercedes 1-2-3-4 POGCHAMP.
That genuinely could have killed Vettel. What happened to the wheel tethers? Alfa need to have the book thrown at them for that.
Hope Albon gets that place back
are mercedes fucked? the field is closer and closer and they have to avoid the kerbs.
"to me it looks like the tyre came off the rim.

safe from alpha, bad from pirelli?"
Patience young padawan...
Ham playing dirty now I guess
"That’s gotta be a penalty on Hamilton, no?"
Hamilton should be punished for the that for sure.
HaMiLtOn PeNalTy
Lewis gearbox explosion would show that god is merciful
"Crofty, that's Norris, you pillock."
[deleted]
"Incredible race, should be 10 second penalty he cleared him out fucking sick joke"
ReVIEW REPLAY. HAMILTON DID NOTHING WRONG.
Merc really fucked that strategy. They should have let Lewis by Bottas and let him run it as hard as possible to try to keep 1-2. I wouldn't put it past Bottas to have slowed him down over the last half of a lap to put Lewis at a disadvantage as well.
ALBON!?!?
It would be great if the most prestigious racing in the world didn't have 70 IQ announcers.
held together only by Lewis taking out Albon though.......
someone should tell these lads that they're not supposed to be touching the front of their masks while they're on lmao
A little bit of luck? Man you got there with 90% luck?
"Vettel is a finished driver, no longer WDC quality. He lost control of his car too easily there."
ham engine go poof poof pls
lol gonna be a Merc 1-2 every single race until the season is over - constructors/drivers championship is already wrapped up
Just confirms my hatred for Hamilton
[deleted]
Not lewis his fault. Unlucky
I don’t understand so many ppl here blaming Lewis for that. I think folks getting cloudy judgement from the Merc dominance
What a shitshow that Red Bull is.
karma for taking albon's wing
"I'd be so just if the Pink Mercedes has the same heating problems as the old mercedes, karma."
Why do the curbs even have bumps?
pay-to-win is not a thing in F1 #Latifi
Commentators doing their best to hype a dead race still.
Jesus fuck Hamilton
"Thats on Hamilton lol, 100%"
That's on Lewis.
YES. GET FUCKED LEWIS
5 seconds.... I think Lewis will keep 2nd
Nah thats bullshit. Albon had to let that go
Has Lewis started moaning yet?
Merc can just leave the sport please. We get it. 1 - 2 e every race. Bit dry
Lewis has absolutely nowhere to go there. He was in the corner and on the racing line.
If Albon waited until he had an opportunity he wins. Rookie mistake. He’ll learn.
Hamilton is a cock
"Wow look Sainz managed to not take Charles out in the same exact situation, fucking Lewis."
Fuck Hamilton. Cheating shit
Wow Lewis could have gotten P1 if it wasn’t for the orders to stay inside when Bottas wasn’t staying inside
"Roses are red

Trees are green

Vettel getting pressured

Watch him spin."
Thank God for that penalty. Tired of Lewis pulling that
Get fucked Hamilton
"Cool, we get it, F1TV isn’t working. Complain to someone who can do something about it."
"That's it, the season is over. Mercedes WCC, Hamilton WDC confirmed.

Red Bull *fucked it up* in the one season where they could not afford any fuckups. This is entirely their own fault."
Oh man Hamilton must be penalized
Perez still hasnt given the spot back. The sport is a rigged mess.
Fuck Hamilton
Fuck Lewis. Killed a good run by Albon. Perpetual cheat.
Haha fuck Lewis
Red Bull to protest Verstappen's DNF?
I'm so hard right now!
It is finally here. Wow. I can’t believe it.
"Let's focus on the racing finally,this should be a good one!"
Going to be watching my Norris @ 40/1 Cash Out bet like a hawk in the first few laps.
"Hi I’m a new fan, last year was my first. I have a bit of a technical question:

Is it ok if going forward I refer to Latifi as “Fee-fee”?"
I hope Nico Hulkenberg does well today!
Congratulations on the win Bottas.
Norris with a great start
Vettel having a mare of a race.
Jesus Lewis' pace is scary
Leclerc dropping back on Perez
What’s the deal with the merc engines smoking? 👀
It's bizzare to see 4 time WDC in Ferrari who can't catch Stroll .
It’s a clown!
Karma
"And that's the race over, see you next week folks"
Noooo Max :(
You love to see it.
It looks like his car IS taking the knee
Can Red Bull protest Honda?
No joke. I dreamed last night that both Verstappen and Bottas DNF'd do to engine problems
Karma
"As if it was not enough that Mercedes is racing with an airplane, their most probable competitor to stop the 1-2 just had a mechanical failure.

Yeah of course they will never lose this way, not only they are faster, but it seems they are also the least likely to be unlucky."
"Lmao RTL commercial break missed ver going out fuck it ä, glad they won’t be there next year"
Bottas is the only hope now
So now we get to watch bottas out front the whole race becausw the director doesn't know any other racing is occurring
Was an exciting season. See you next year
alternate strategy and lewis penalty all for nothing. race is over lap 12 great
"See you in two weeks, hopefully in Hungary it will be competitive"
"Maybe Max will claw his way back like last year...

WELP. NEVER MIND."
Aaahhh shit! That's a shame!! Thought he was in for the win
VTEC wasn't kicked in.
Marko gonna figure out a way to blame this on Mercedes
"Less buttons, more, eh Max?"
"""red bull need to maximise their point and give all to max"""
This championship was fun while it wasn't already won by Lewis
Just give HAM the championship trophy. Season is over boys.
Okay but that Honda engine gurgle made me erect
Looking forward to Mercedes to use DAS to make the softs last longer than Seb's Mediums.
Really hoping Albon gets a podium. Still early in the race though.
What happened to Max? Did the car just die?
Renault officially doesn't have the worst engine on the grid lmao
"So with Max out, do you think they'll move the new wing to Albon's car on the next pit, or is the setup going to be off?"
"Not another mercedes 1-2 again, I'm tired of it"
I love Max but something about watching Horner get a metaphorical kick in the teeth brings me so much joy.
They put a Renault Clio engine in Daniel’s car wtf
My Fantasy team is collapsing on itself
Everyone dnf and ferrari win
Man. I did not miss feeling like this. I guess I'll root for Albon and Norris now.
Bad luck Ric
First race I've ever watched live and my two drivers are out before lap 20. This is fun.
Gasly's passed Stroll now.
"Who is in charge of directing this fucking shitshow. Why do we need to see two replays of nothing happening. Who the fuck wants to see Battle for 14th between the same team members. Why do I need to see a replay of Lewis ""started from 5th still on 5th"". JFC"
FUCK MY HOME RACER TOO
Beta Bottas is back.
Romain is so done
"Ferrari: Look guys we won't be fast, but we'll try to finish the race"
Bottas just dropped over a second last lap
HAAS HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Haas back at it again.
Oh Haas....
Race = over
I think KMag forgot he has to turn; can't just go in a straight line.
"""Ocon can't outbreak me if I dont break at all"""
kimi is so unlucky
Latifi has actually doing pretty well so far.
Hamilton gonna overtake and  cruise to win
Ferrari might be saved from being lapped
Just when Kimi tried to undercut Mag + Ocon and Magnussens car fails
Reminder Ferrari still havent moved up 30 laps in
Why does the VSC exist if not for a situation exactly like this?  Ridiculous.
I wonder if Valtteri and Lewis are about to take each other out for the first time
lmao vettel nice move
And of course Vettel is the one that gets fucked lol
vettel is so done with this shit
Wtf was Vettel thinking
Vettel just needs to retire now. Crap
Netflix cameraman sure is busy today.
"Vettel mate, what is you doin"
VETTEL SPINS AGAIN AHAHAHAHAHA EMBARASSING
Chances of Russell getting some points today? Up in 12th
OH NOOOOO SEB. :(
Williams in front of Ferrari again
How is latifi that far back from a restart? 24 seconds back on the first lap back racing?
Ocon in the points
VETTEL DJDKD
"Just Joined. please can you give me a little bit of an update on:

Max - why did he retire?

Lando race start and drive so far?

Albon race start and drive o far?

stroll - why did he retire?"
[deleted]
Latiffi..
Lewis wants this.
Sainz has been all race chasing Leclerc but hardly able to attack him.
"I like the graphics, but sometimes I don't want to see a million numbers when looking at an onboard. Would be nice to just see the car."
Who are Aramco?
Man the HUD halo upgrades this year are cool
I have a feeling Lewis will pull a multi-21 move and go for it while Bottas switched the engine down.
If Lewis was ahead the Mercedes wouldn't be allowed to race.
Now Ferarri is so shit maybe its time to start thinking of curtailing that excessive prize money they get.
Let them fight Merc
Multi 21!
Perez is dropping again
The Sky commentators are really good at not talking through the F1 radio today /s
"Fucking Team Order.

""Kerbs"" my ass..


Mercedes just wants to bring home the 1, 2."
It'll be incredible if the two Mercs end up taking each other out and we end up with Albon getting his first podium.
C'mon! Hit each other!
Its James let Lewis pass you stupid ass
People calling LH petty and not following orders...Bottas taking more kerbs than him taking the piss.
Weird that Ferrari didn't submit a team this year to race.
"2020 F1: interesting midfield

2020 tv direction: 5hours of merc nonstop"
"It's like Mercedes is playing a video game on easy mode. 

Boring."
Now let's see 3-5 instead....
If there is justice left on the world then the gearboxes on the mercs will detonate!
"At first I didn't notice Russel had a problem,thought it was the normal William pace"
The Merc engine is shit.
Latifi>Russell confirmed
Grosjean trundling along on the escape road was hilarious
PER>NOR
Merc 1-4
As a latin american I would be so happy with a Checo podium
How is PER ahead of ALB?
"Come on Alex, channel your inner Verstappen"
Albon or Norris could get their forst podium today!
Thats...Albons spot
wow what a disaster of a race
"Now a Mercedes 1,2,3,4"
wtf is this race
ALBON IS ABOUT TO GET HIS REVENGE FOR BRAZIL
Crew needs to work double time. Albon is on softs. Get the race started.
These safety cars have been perfectly timed to my nicotine cravings
Is there a limit to how many times safety car can be used? It also seems like having a safety car is a gap equalizer. How is that fair for the leader if they have a huge interval gap?
How the fuck Peres is 3rd?
"silly raikonen loses a wheel, drives back to the track. who cares really"
"I'm surprised there isn't a safety system for ensuring wheel nuts are secure. All you do is make sure there's electrical connectivity between wheel gun, nut, and anchor. If there isn't the wheel isn't secure and you can't release."
"Albon in third, with almost fresh softs and Mercedes doesn't want their cars to use the curbs. This is not over"
Anybody know the max amount of retirements from any race? Are we close at all?
Albon time!
LMAAAOOO
Hamilton yet again ruins a potential albon podium
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE HAMITLON PENALTY??????????
A guide on how to fuck up by Albon
HAMILTON YOU \*\*\*\*
Hamilton acting like an NPC.
That has to be a penalty
"God damn Lewis, leave the kid some space"
Hamilton dogged him
Just skip this season
Dirty fucking move
Brazil flashback.
Omg- was that lewis' fault? Alex was ahead and it kinda looked like he pushed him off
Damn it Albon..
This is such a wild ride.
"F1 is boring tho, amirite?"
"Not pointing fingers at all here towards Lewis or Alex, but Martin really seems to be doing everything to avoid blaming Hamilton at all. Even .0001& of the blame."
i dont think this was hamilton fault. Just look at his steering wheel.
"This whole race has been a shitshow, to say the least."
Hamilton needs to take notes from Norris
Albon was ahead of him and Hamilton tried to push him off the track. 100% on Lewis. Guess no one should overtake on corners anymore.
"May end up a racing incident, but seriously that was some bs move Lewis"
Leclerc doing miracles
"Likely a penalty for Hamilton, but Albon really needs to pick where he goes for a pass better - he was on softs, there was no need to rush it on a risky overtake"
YES CHARLES YES
LMAO is Ferrari gonna get a podium???
"Come on, let's have both mercedes broken down now"
"Vettel still 11th lol, with so many cars retired"
"Justice. 

5 sec penalty"
Time penalty.. that was kind.
Hamilton penalty and charles overtaking! Fuck dont give me hope ferrari
5 secs are you kidding me?
Merc should let Hamilton pass Bottas and just see how far he can get
Thank god a five second penalty! Did not get away with it this time.
5 second penalty damn
Charles is having a very lucky day.
Joke of a penalty for Hamilton that. Racing incident. Move along. That’s what that was. Disgusting decision
HAMILTON PENALTY YES
Did Ham make contact?
Knew it. That was very dirty from Lewis. Pass was completed. Ferrari gonna get a podium Ahahahaha
"C'mon Lando. Hold off Carlos til the end, lad"
Thank fucking god holy fuck
"Everyone: Ferrari absolute shite
Leclerc: lol podium"
"5 seconds is a fucking joke, should be more"
"Yeah, that was definitely an avoidable collision."
How can Lewis be so fucking lucky
Taking your rival out of the race = speeding in the pit lane. This is stupid
There is no question Hamilton is brilliant driver but only then he is faster if he is slower then thee car behind he always fucks everything up.
What a scum move from Hamilton seeing it again. Opened up the wheel just enough to bump him off the track.
"Hamilton is ahead into the corner, ahead at apex, not ahead on exit, but at full lock. Albon jumped into a closing space that Hamilton literally couldn't avoid going into, joke penalty."
"C'mon Norris, get close!"
Perez black flag
"Thanks Perez... don't want HAM off the podium, very cool and very legal.

Also if HAM was ahead going into corner how the fuck is he supposed to adjust his racing line in 0.1 sec to Alex doing crazy shit."
"So much happening, but none of it helping Esteban"
TWITCH GANG
Lando!!!
This race was a fucking meme and I love it
"Mercedes should have let Lewis past, would have had p1&2"
Social distancing Lando.
"It would be different in spring, but mid July it should be obvious that Lewis is the assistant driver for the remainder of the season :)
Valtteri is clear #1"
Best race since Hockenheim 2019
"""Some"" crashes is an understatement"
Did you see that ludicrous display just now...!
2020 is wack
Maybe the on track podium isn’t so bad
"I feel for Albon and Lewis. Lewis must feel awful hitting him again. Brazil was 50/50 as Alex said, this one more Lewis’. Never meant it but misjudged where Alex was. He was fully steering away but too fast"
Disqualify Ham
Alex tried way too hard. Should’ve been more patient.
Norris looking like he's about to drop down the field.
Albon is having a great defense from Hamilton.
Hahahahah
That's gotta suck for RBR. Karma
end the season I don't care
Can’t wait for someone to blame this on Max not kneeling
So that rbr protest turned out to be useless
"Welp Mercedes is 1-2

see you next year lads for the same shit it was good while it lasted."
Stop showing Verstappen in the garage and let us watch the race!
"Romain ""Why they don't pay me as much as Hamilton"" Grosjean proving his driving skills there"
First time watching. Is Haas always this bad?
Haas drivers looking like me in codemasters
Good to see the three Mercedes leading :)
"A brand new feature on Sky F1, Christian Horner gives his thoughts from the pit wall during the race

Unique feature, well done sky"
Fucking Hotstar. Ruining an already depressing race.
"Seb spins, best news ever."
Jesus christ he can't handle pressure
"Fuck it, I am out. Only good result out of this mess of a race is Albon/Norris on podium"
Mistake from Vettel for sure but didnt help that the ferrari is such a piece of shit it was basically out of control before he even made it to the corner.
"This shows exactly why Ferrari aren't renewing Vettel; he always has a mistake in him, and he no longer consistently delivers the pace to justify it."
"I stg if Merc has already powered down Valtteri's car but ""forgot"" to power down Lewis' car and  right after he passes, he'll be powered down as well"
Sensor issues on both Mercs! There is hope!
Yeah just gift valtteri the win. Jesus christ
Did Crofty just say Mercedes are 10 seconds a lap quicker?
I put 10 bucks on a Red Bull winning; Mercedes pls blow your engines :p
How does Grosjean still have a job?
"f1 commentators: do not miss the last 20 laps

Me: yaaaaaaaaaawn"
Kimi takes the knee
Crofty has smooth brain
Why did that thing that keeps the wheel from flying off not work? How do they attach that anyway?
Hamilton?????
"Jesus, Alex, just take your podium!"
lmao English commentary
CLASSIC LEWIS
"Ah come on, you kidding Ham, seriously"
Lando podium by Hamilton penalty for taking out Albon again? This is some monkey’s paw level shit.
"Ok, I gotta give that to Lewis. Albon was ahead."
I hate this race.
FUCK HAMILTON
It's going to be a racing incident. Otherwise we're going to have to give penalties for anyone touching another car.
All Albon had.to do was wait for the straight.
God I fucking hate Leclerc
[removed]
Mercedes better appeal this.
[deleted]
Racing incident. Wasn't a clear fault from either driver tbf.
All that protesting to get Lewis to 5th just to get zero points for their main driver. Oof
Penalty for HAM
ffs thats a penalty for ham
Hahahahah take that Hamilton CHEAT
"Yo Lando, my boy. I think the penalty is utterly bullshit but not sad to see Lando on the podium. Team were shit though, obviously just killed any fight once they were 1-2. I get with a shortened season they are scared of crashes but still weak sauce, Ham was obviously much faster and gaining hand over fist whenever he wanted to."
I must say the black Merc looks pretty slick
"So bot ham ver, see you next weekend :/ where it's gonna be repeated LOL joke of a sport"
Karma
Trash season it is then.
Lewis catching up on Bottas and watch Merc give him the best strat even when he's behind.
Hamilton will destroy Bottas change my mind
Was there really a need for safety car?
Vettel might be the most overrated driver of all time.
"Vettel had to go for it, but locking up didn't help his case."
I no longer think that Vettel is a very good driver. At least not any more.
someone should slash all mercedes tires before the race
Did they remove the ropes or whatever that keep the tyres from flying away?
[deleted]
"So with Hamilton getting a penalty, we're looking at Bottas, Perez and Norris on the podium... I guess I can live with that but that was Albon's race to win


Edit- Spoke too soon, Mad Man Leclerc has something to say about this lol"
Please give Hamilton a 5 second penaly
"Not sure how Hamilton can be punished there, seemed like Hamilton stuck to the racing line. Albon had the tyre advantage, no reason to be so impatient."
Penalty for Lewis! Oh no. That looked like a racing incident.
[deleted]
The worst part of this race is Ferrari getting an undeserved podium
"Absolutely horseshit way for Landon to make the podium, but I'm happy for him"
"I still think that if you take out a driver on the track, in this case Hamilton taking out Albon, the penalty should always be so large that the one taking out the driver should finish behind the one he took out"
Mercedes are clueless
"Kinda disappointed that Carlos didn't take the knee, but we move nonetheless"
"All I'm asking for is both Mercs to crash, Red Bull 1-2 and Sainz in 3rd. Not too much imo"
LETS GO MERCCCCCC
This kind of dominance is NOT good for the sport.  I'd be happy if I didn't see another Merc the rest of the race.
"But yeah, Ferrari should've sticked with Seb anyway!"
Lol karma for Horner shit stirring
Honda strikes again
[deleted]
God if Mercedes did that we'd have 100 comments here going on about fake pitstops and how the rules apparently don't apply to them
One thing for sure Haas line up is shit
"All of this protesting, talking their car up for the title, for Redbull to last 14 laps embarrassing."
[deleted]
bullshit. only 5 seconds?  drive through start stop MINIMUM
Albon wouldve won if not for Lewis not being used to being overtaken.... That move was not fit for a multiple world champion...
[removed]
Lets go
"Oh damn was that a P-38 lightning? 

edit: https://i.imgur.com/BraPzeO.png IT WAS"
Haven’t been this excited for a race in a long while
We’re on lads let’s go
Nerves of 1st corner building
"Finally, it's here!! So excited!!!!!"
"Meh.. its smoke and shit, could easily miss it."
If Merc were to leave F1 then that would be massive.
"I know, the FOM feed was showing the planes but then they cut back to the sky feed for an interview."
A really strong rainstorm just kicked up where I am and I s2g if I lose power or internet during the next two hours I'm going to cry
It’s finally here! I’m so hyped man!
Hoping Bottas 3.0 makes the title race a little more interesting.
If Max can stay with Bottas he will win
"Idk who to root for, but I’m excited!"
So hyped can't sit still lol
"Good morning guys. Hopefully midtable battles are going to be great, and i predict a Racing Point podium"
Hamilton starting P3 instead of P2?
Those are some tight grisjeans.
"What would everyone prefer, an exciting race but a Mercedes wins (say Hamilton wins), or a boring race but a different team wins?"
I’m so glad haas looks normal again
#WE BACK BOYS
Feels so good to be back bois!
So excited to watch this race!  Even if f1tv isn't working....
"Ugh, so happy we’re finally here. :)"
Let's gooooo!!!
"Seeing how many people are complaining about F1TV right now really makes me appreciate Mothers even more!

Go buy some freaking car polish, people!"
It's oooonnnnnnn!!!!
I hope it pisses down and we require full wets!
F1 theme hype. Finally
DU DU DU DU DU DUUUUUUU
I MISSED THAT SONG
The hype is real Bois!!
HYPE
We’re back baby
That gave me mad GOOSEBUMPS!!
***HYPE MUSIC***
Tararararara
I've missed this theme so much.
"Okay, anyone taking bets on how many of the drivers cook it into T1?"
Ive missed this
Mybodyisready.jpeg
Lets fucking go!
"Hello all from sunny Ohio! Excited for today, and I hope everyone is having a great day so far!"
Oh god I missed this
"Kvyat looks so smug in his intro pose, lol"
Funky music time!
Intro music be like: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qC5DxgfndD4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qC5DxgfndD4)
can not connct via browser but the app seems to be fine
WE’RE BACK
I'm shaking. Been excited for a while. Most exciting ever for F1 probably
That HealthyWage thing I just got a TV commercial for is the most Black Mirror-ass shit I've ever seen in real life.
Yeeees!!!!
"When the beat drops and Crofty reads the facts, that gets the hype up"
Finally working!
chances Max goes into Anti-Stall in the first race of the year.
YESSSSSSS
LFG!!!!!!!!
[removed]
Here we go
Lando will botch the start. Hamilton second by turn 1.
It's been months...It's Sunday!
Let's goooo!
Letss goo and have fun laddsss. Hope for a Papaya podium today
Oh shit new intro montage??
Does Liberty broadcast in 4k?
I legit cried tears of joy during the intro.
That cloud looks like f1 car
I always feel sorry for the poor graphics guys when somebody gets a last minute penalty.
"Good luck, good race"
ITS TIME BOYS AND GIRLS! ENJOY!
So excited for this. Enjoy everyone!
the intro feels nostalgic
Austria looks like it’s the shape of Starlord’s gun.
Does Stroll fuck up going into 1?
damn bottas really be posing like he got into trouble and his parents called him.
Anyone have a stream f1 tv is down
"Gonna guess Bottas max Lewis I suppose for
Podium"
Should I watch it on ESPN or sky sports?
How much time it will take to start the race from now ?
Let's hope it's anything like last year's amazing race!
I don't even mind if Mercedes runs off into the distance. I am so happy that Formula 1 is back! Let's fucking go!!!
This is it guys!
GOD I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I WAS THIS EXCITED!
"I told myself i wouldn't cry, but I really miss Toro Rosso. Alpha Tauri is just not the same"
Excited to see how Racing Point performs today!
I'm looking forward to Ocon's new tornado spin attack move
WE BACK BOISSS
Someone PM a link to a stream since F1TV doesnt work please
Loving everyone looking serious and then Russel with a huge grin
I'm so ready for this!
I think one of the pieces of good news is we will see Ferrari in lots of exciting on-track battles....likely with McLaren.
Wow take a breath crofty lmao.
waahhh 1 minite
*its been 98 years since the last race....*
"I can already feel this is going to be good, come on!"
Hype music has been modified for some reason which makes it slightly less hyped but the engine howls have been dearly missed
Verstappen takes out bottas into T1.
I don’t know if I ever saw a reason but why are they racing Austria twice? Is it due to the 2 week symptoms for Covid?
IT'S TIMEEEEEEEE
LETS FUKCING GOOO!
Here we goooooo!!!!
"Rosberg is such a smoothie, it‘s ridiculous..."
"Here we go ladies and gents. 

Here we fucking go!!!"
"Bottas should comfortably win this, hope nothing stupid happens in the first few corners."
FINALLYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I'm so excited to finally see a race again.
We back 🙌🏽🙌🏽
Cmon Lando and George <3!!!
formation lappppp
Is P11 better than P10 for Vettel? He can start on mediums now.
I'm so hyped
Does anybody know how much delayed the ESPN stream is?
WE GO RACING TODAAAYYYY
"Any engine mode turned up on all Ferrari PU for this race ? It's not an aero upgrade they are missing , because all Ferrari powered cars where going slow in quali"
Here we go!!! I've missed this feeling.
Let’s fucking goooo
"Come on Dan, let's go!!!"
It's happening
I really hope Latifi is able to finish with his debut
Bottas made a break for it
THE LIGHTS ARE OUt
HEREE WE GOOOOOOOOOOO
First time waking up for a race. Been addicted to watching all the online series. This is awesome
I‘M SO HYPED LET‘S GO
Here we go
Oh god I'm so nervous!
These first 2 laps could be wild.
LETS GO!!!!! Lando for the win!
LETS GOOOOOOO
The TV directors have to focus on the racing for once. Good luck to them
There they go!
That mid pack Ferrari 😑
It's so good to be back!!
I miss these pre start nerves
Here we go!
[deleted]
What was Hamilton's penalty?
Its been a while this feeling. Lets go!
Somehow Hamilton will manage to win
I want to see the cars director...not a face shot of a helmented driver.
Good to be back ladies and gentlemen
George p14
That Heineken billboard is genius
Is there a live thread?
Oh mah god its actually happening
**H Y P E**
So pumped. Hope it’s a cracking race lads.
did anybody else notice the sky commentary mentioned the imperial march clip uploaded on reddit?
Lets goooo
Finally i cant wait to hear those words from crofty!
Soooo excited
Is anyone else apart from Max on mediums?
"It will suck next year without RTL showing the race for you once F1TV inherently fails. Anyway, let's have a great race today."
Bottas needs to pull ahead before DRS
"Well that's an emphatic tyre choice by the bottom 10, is Verstappen in with a shot here?"
Here we go :)
"Holy fuck this track is so pretty.  
  
I swear F1 makes me add more list of places I want to visit. My bank account in the future is gonna be the same as my IQ"
Why doesn't anyone start on Hard tyres and switch to softs when the car is lighter on fuel and there is more rubber down?
Let’s goooo
"Ferrari fans, how are you feeling?"
May the McLarens be reliable.
Lewis' tits gone yet?
Does Bottas have the biggest discrepancy between helmet design and personality? The Monster logos and modern design don't match someone who seems like a super chill guy most of the time.
does anyone have a stream link??f1tv doesnt work
ive missed this
F1TV is working on my phone. Everyone having issues should try that as well.
Very slow lining up
Yessss it's time!!
love the heineken billboard with the 0.0% part of the add invisible in the glare.
Toto looks pumped!
Ok finally
Giggity
"Expecting Bottas to cruise away with this tbh.

Lewis and Max scraping for 2 and 3."
"Thank you everyone, lets go and enjoy this race."
ITS LIGHT OUT AND AWAY WE GO
ITS LIGHTS OUT AND AWAY WE GO
Go go go
This is so exciting
and away we go! :)
Good luck everyone! \*crosses fingers\*
FIVE RED LIGHTS
Let's go
"A podium for McLaren, points for William, and a different winner than Hamilton is all I want from this season."
"It's lights out, and boogity, boogity, boogity, we're finally racing, boys!"
Lights out!
Wooooo time to go
Hopefully some redemption today for Esteban Ocon
"""**AND IT'S LIGHTS AND AWAY WE GO!!!**"""
Hornerception
I'm so nervous
Good start Norris u succulent man
That first turn fear
GOOO
My yearly. Ferrari WDC 2020!

#LIGHTS OUT
LIGHTS OUT

"robottas.exe loading

"At long last... The five red lights are out and it's **GO, GO, GO!!**"
LIGHTS OUT AND AWAY WE GO
IT'S LIGHTS OUT FOR THE START OF THE 2020 F1 SEASON
Lets go
AHHHHHHHHHH
AND ITS LIGHTS OUT AND AWAY WE GOOO
Let's gooo
Bottas taking off
The Ferraris are so slow!
Tracing points are coming
I was expecting a pile up there
Fucking hell Bottas is gone already
"I hope you have beverages close at hand, because after 217 days, It's time to go racing!"
fuck me it's so good to have this back
My boy Norris
IT'S HAPPENING
"Oh shit, great start for Max!"
"Both in premier league and in f1, hotstar streams have been atleast 30 seconds late, sucks for a paid subscription... reddit always reacts before"
And Bottas is gone
Lando need to get pass max quickly. Cmon lando
Bye Bottas see you at the finish line!
My prediction: Hamilton will make a mistake and crash.
Bottle going to the MOON. BYEEE
"Lol, can't even log in now"
"Holy shit, these Mercs ARE really that fast."
"Without the fans to cut the camera feed to, you know they're gonna spend a ton of time highlighting the grandstands covered in advertisements. 

Gonna see more ads than racing so Liberty Media can pay the bills."
Legoooooo
Holy fuck. It’s really back. They’re actually racing
HERE WE GO!!!
Bye Mercedes
So hyped!
gwan Lando!
First start of the season and it's clean!
Albon is being unsafe.
Impressive pace by Norris!
Waited three months for this!  And now I can't watch because F1TV is broken.  So glad I paid for the year in advance; *definitely* the right call by Liberty to not offer refunds or anything....
Lando has a really good chance today. Already putting up a fight for 2nd. Hope he manages to get something out of this race.
Man insane by Albon
McLaren on RB looking great
Congrats to Bottas on the win!
Great start from Lando!
Bottas already gone.
Checo giving Leclerc a hard time. Woot!
PEREZ!
That racing point loves to smoke
My heart can't take this
Force indias hella smokey
Wow a clean first lap
whats with the racing points? huge puffs of smoke at t1
Elbows out all over the shop! Love it!
[deleted]
Racing Points are smoking??
Racing point smoking?
They're going at it
Racing point Smoking every right turn
Hamilton looking rusty as hell
Sergio is still smoking
Great start by Alex
Looks like Lewis got an Al-biff
The Racing points engines are gonna explode? They left smoke
Are both racing points breaking down?
Things are getting dicey so far
Damnit George dropped to 19
Lots of smoke coming from the racing point cars
Get in checo
Well done by Max holding his place with this compound
McLaren has improved hugely it seems
Smoke from racing point?
Checo fighting Charles and winning lmao.
Interesting to see Leclerc driving for midfield Ferrari take on a top tier team in Racing Point so early
The pink mercedes really likes to smoke doesn't it
Both of the pink panthers smoking like crazy
Nothing really happened at the start
Come on Lando!!!
Woo Perez loving this
Both racing points smoking a lot
Bottas is flying away!
"Vettel and Ricciardo fighting again, good old 2014"
There’s the only time you’ll see Hamilton and Vettel on the same screen for the rest of this race
Both racing points keep blowing smoke out?
Ferrari is slow as heck
Lots of smoke from the rap cars
This race will be MAD. Fuck I missed this.
Go on Lando!
"Bottas **will** check out if you let him, he's notorious for it. Could spell trouble."
Woopee we are back!!
LOOK AT BOTTAS GO
"That squeeze from Albon, bravo"
Mercedes OP
Ferrari so slow on straights
Racing Dot are quicker than Ferrari
bye bye Williams
"My God, this is already a good race"
Leclerc is slow like a tractor lmaao
I know it's only lap three but lets fucking go Lando
Bottas is gone jesus
Great start for Magnussen!
"Man Albon with the elbows out on Lewis! Those Racing Points are smoking up a storm though, wonder what on earth is going on they've been doing that all weekend"
Good first 2 laps for Bottas
Holy shit Valtteri is gone
Holy crap 3 laps already
WTF Bottas is a mile ahead....!
RP are real smokey aren't they
I hope that Seb and Leglerg can still salvage this.
"Right season is over, look how far Bottas is ahead already ffs. No one to fight against the Mercs."
"Good start by KMag, but still expect Haas to fuck up somehow"
Okay this is awesome
Whoa Gio went up real fast
"Norris looked fast at start. 
Bottas just straight gone."
Congrats to Bottas on winning the first GP of the year 🤣
Noo lando down to p4
Sainz getting to know his future teammate
Yay first missed midfield battle of the season
"Oh fuck yes, the two Red Bulls are off to a great start so far!"
Where the fuck are the graphics
Bottas not winning time in the last 2 laps or so.
1.09?  That is a slow opening lap.
2.5 seconds ahead already...
Man I'm so glad f1 is back
Norris take my energy
Ocon overtaking Kimi
Max wow.
Lando noo
Bottas is such a good starter
"You should not be able to just push people off the track like that into the run off. SO fucking tired of seeing that shit from everyone. Ruins good battles, shows no respect for each other."
Lando dropping
Norris struggling! Get up there
"3rd lap: „Look after your car“


Says it all tbh"
Looks like Leclerc doesn’t gain anything visually on that RP
McLaren’s race pace....
Max's start onboard will be fun to see.
"How is Max doing fastest lap now, he's got the medium tyres?!"
Yikes. Bottas is already with a big gap
Solid start.  Race is going to get interesting near the end just like Le Mans because of the heat and tyre deg.  I watched a bit of drag racing last night on Murda's stream in prep for this and I am so sooooo happy to have F1 back :)
Max gonna be on fresher hard tyres at the end here. This gonna be spicy
What a start from Kmag
Ferrari welcome to the Midfield
Kimi.... how? Antonio is going great
Bottas not extending the lead so far.
These tracking helicopter shots are amazing.
Both Ferrari's stuck behind RP
McLaren rip :(
The kerb sound is fascinating
Hamilton about to take another podium away from Albon
Wow we cant even get in DRS range
the f1 cars sound like they are farting when crossing the camera
What's the optimal pit strategy? One stop or two stops?
Who did Seb go past to get to 10th?
"Lando looking slow, this sucks"
Heavy oil burning from Racing Point
How long can we expect these mediums to last?
lets go bottas
Brazil 2019 flashbacks intensify
Hamilton catching Albon
That's a great helicopter shot
"The cars SOUND great this year, much improved."
You uh..wanna make a few moves there Vettel?
Renault 😬😬
Does anyone have a clip of gio's first lap? 19th -> 14th and no coverage on sky F1...
Holy camera angle! Turn 1 looking up to turn 3
Williams showing promising pace.
Did they say what was causing the racing point smoke? It definitely doesnt look healthy
Seb is still in 10th
"Merc are on a whole another level, oof. Only way RB can win us with better strategy."
Albon defending well so far
Interesting that in the pre-race interview Toto seemed concerned with reliability.
"Great start from KMag, but the Haas car is just ass. So depressing to watch. I wonder how long Haas will stay in F1, it seems hopeless right now."
"There is no live track map on web browser, just in the f1 mobile app?"
"So from my understanding Luca di Montezmolo firing Jean Todt and Ross Brawn really ruined Ferrari huh? 

Or got rid of them one way or the other I forget."
Cmon Verstappen pick up the pace
Anyone having streaming issues on ESPN?
Albon is looking pretty impressive. Despite just being overtaken
Esteban so close to Giovinazzo
"I find it amusing how from one race to another Kvyat loses a couple of positions at the start and then takes them back during the next 5-10 laps.

Actually, I just understood why he made the most overtakes during previous season (he did, if I remember correctly, right?)"
Alex doing his job!
DRS!
"Way to go Albon! Love to see him doing well.
Though a shame Lewis has now passed him."
I love all the new engine sounds
Oh boi this merc is something else. More like 2 years of development in an entire year
Shoutout to espn for giving us here in the US a way to watch! First time watching and already enjoying it!
Why are all of the mercedes engines smoking so much?
Albon to crash into Ham in the final lap...
Are Merc drivers using the DAS ? Hopefully Lance gets it for the next race as well.
Lewis up to speed.
Wow. Merc scary
Albon put up a good effort defending against Lewis. I’m  impressed
Why is he blumig the Red bull pace. Verstappen is on Mediums
Man it'll be really sad if Perez also overtakes Norris
Mama mia...
Mercedes Red Bull Mercedes Red Bull. One two three four. Lando Norris at the door.
Both Ferrari 2 seconds behind Racing Point in front of them...
The gap b/w stroll and vettel is increasing.
Racing Point is kind of quick eh?
"Good lord, the drs is awful here. The lead car gets hunted down for 3 zones with no defense."
"F2 commentators: the race pace of merc shown in practice/qualifying can be seen in race too

surprisedpikachu.png"
Lol Mercedes is a rocketship
The track mics look like tribbles chilling out on the barriers
[deleted]
NOOOOOO
Does anyone care about the Leader gap graphics? All I really want to know is the intervals between each car.
Oh shit he coming
Ferrari has a great chance to win the race for the mid pack this year
Oh fuck this
VerSTOPpen
Verstappen's car is broken!
Vers out!
Thank you Martin for confirming Ferrari is a POS this year lol
"Russel is staying within 1s of Grosjean, and Latifi isn't far behind either. Very positive start for Williams."
OH FOR FUCKS SAKE RED BULL
Rip Verstappens car
Petition to decide the race on who has the best AWS corner ratings.
No way Max...
Aw no Max
Noooooooooooooo
ARE YOU KIDDING ME
F1 is poopy :(
"I don't think the middle DRS zone needs deleting Martin, all the passing has been at the end of the 3rd one across the weekend

1st 2 needed to close them up, then let them race hard without it down to turn 5"
"Oh, Max

Noooooo"
Noooooooooooo Max
Is 3rd best team to 7th best team F1.5? (Obviously to 10th best but 8th to 10th are in the back anyway)
oh boy
Ferrari yikes
"It's only ""too easy"" cause the merc engine is good.  Is it too easy for everyone else?"
Oh no Max!
Ferrari is really struggling.
What?!??! Max?!!
"Oh no, Max!"
Max out :(
RIP
Oh man Max

OH NO MAX
Rip ver
FFS RED BULL
"Lovely pattern in the standings. Merc, rb  merc, rb. Mcl, rp, fer, mcl, rp, fer."

OH GOD OH FUCK
"Rip Verstappen.
Good win for Bottas"
Nooooooooo max
It’s over boys :(
Well shit.
Did these fuckers just learn what DRS stands for? they've already said it at least 10 times in 9 laps.
Racing gods are cruel :(
AH
FUCK
Fuck... fuck fuck fuck
NO EXCUSES
HONDA!

"RIP Max.

Now we have an utter shite boring procession."
F1TV started working for me.
Well that's the fun part of the race.
FUVK NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Bad luck Max
Verstappen. Fuck!
This Ferrari engine does not sound much healthy...
"Honda farts.

or a Honda trombone?"
Nooooooooo!
Honda strikes again!
Ffs :(
F
Finally we will see some ric
NOOOO MAX
F
"Oh Romain, you’re so shit. Why does Gene keep you"
F Max
Mercedes group manager was right in his pre-race interview.. something needs to be done to level the playing field!
MAX!!!!!
Goddamit. There goes any chance of a competitive race.
"Like clockwork, fts"
Wtf!!?? There goes my fantasy
Red bulls gone
Red Bull and car failures. Poor Verstappen.
Oh dear...Verstappen
NOoooooo
"Oh, shit..... What the F happened to Max?!"
Fuck
rip rip rip
Wtf verstappen
That's it boys. Pack up. Max is out.
Fuuuuuuuuck!
Classic TSN on a commercial break when Max slowed.
Verstappen hit the fuckin pit limiter at full tilt?
Hahahahahaha fuck you Max
Verdammit
F
congratz merc
LOL Every year something happens to the red bull
Ohhhh fuck
dear oh dear!
anyone have a streaming link? stupid f1tv
Pit limiter engaged? 😂
The 1-2 is inevitable
Is the race director showing midfield battles?!
Congrats on the another 1-2 for Mercedes...
VERSTAPPEN :O FOR FUCK SAKE
He’s back
Honda: power of memes?
FUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
Merc 1-2 again. This is disturbing
F
lol
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
F
Verstappen's power unit sounds like my hedge trimmer.
Well this is a great start ffs
"Remember when i was excited for this season to start today?

Yeah."
Lololol. Looks like Leclerc is faster on the straights than Max now.
Honda went into mode McLaren...
"Max has done this on purpose. Masterclass incoming, win on the way."
Looked like it's been put into the pit setting.
NOOOOOO MAAAXXX!!
Time to stop watching.
OH SHIT
Can't wait for 2021
So much for a title fight
Fuck. :(
All those protests for this!?
OH FUCKS SAKE MAX
Oh shit
Just when Honda seems to be good..
The power of dreams
Max is out of the lead battle now.
That's sad
Dammit...
Poor Max
Our only hope is gone 😭
Lmao RBR overhyping and underdelivering typical
Noooooooo VER!!
Is it serious that F1TV is not going to work during an F1 race? Why do I paid this for?
Hahaha Mercedes 1-2
"Okay, Race is over"
NOOOO
FFS
Welp
Ver down on power!
No no noooooo
BRUHHHHH
"Max, NO!"
Oh shit Max looks over
"Thanks to RTL for missing Verstappen going out, the ads were much better"
"Honda, the power of dreams"
"Yeah, fuck off, there goes whatever interest I had in this race."
Oh no
Back to a Mercedes 1-2. 😂
Horner go beep bleep
Mercedes AMG WCC 2020
What is the ring that horner has ?
Sounds like a tractor
Well that's an F for Max 😔
There we go
MAX NO
Wow... That is all
FUCK
Can someone dm me a stream?
RIP Max holy shit
oh fuck me sideways!
Fuck
Fuck off no Verstappen
RIP championship
That fucking sucks
Omfg how does this happen
Gg
Honda returned to their 2015 - 2017 glory years ?
Red bull never change man fuck
Merc 1-2 and everyone else is shit.
No no no no no no
Verstappen is fuming
Is the pit limiter on?
rip
Oh my god max
Well fuck
NO!
sounds like valves
[deleted]
FUCK
Ah damn it
Shit.....
"Fucking Redbull, Max won't win with them, always something"
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
"It's a sign the F1 season has truly gone back to normal, Mercedes 1-2"
"Welp, Red Bull back to normal as well."
GP2?
Max has disconnected from the session
He’s done
He might have better luck getting out and running laps at this point.
Oh shit
NOOOOOOOOO
That does not sound good oooof completely fucked.
"Is ""bump starting"" the same as push starting?"
Goddamnit
Congratulations with the constructors championship Mercedes!
What did Max say?
Could use a Safety Car right about now
WTF
Merc 1-2....GG
F Versteppan. Albon for podium finish?
fuck
Honda Jokes
Welp it’s officially the Mercedes show now
That's just NOT how I want F1 to start!!! :(
Top driving get that broken thing back home Max. 10/10.
Mercedes 1-2 confirmed. Red Bull ffs
Oh damn
Max taking a Sunday stroll here.
The settings ruined Max's race.
Albon on for his first podium.
This isnt looking promising...
Isn't this the exact same thing that happened last year?
Karmas a bitch
I guess that’s one way for Albon to get a podium and Ferrari to move up in points
Selecting engine settings triggering anti-stall? Possibly a software issue.
Well just like that Mercedes 1 2 again lol
Red Bull fucked up
"Blimey, that must be hurting as the anti stall keeps kicking."
Congratulations Hamilton on your 7th and 8th title
Five new wheels
Live timing has died...
Well. Lewid vs valtteri come the end of the race will be juicy
Awww that's annoying I was interested how Max's strategy would play out
White flag?
"yikes

gg MV"
\#Blessed
Vettel in Strolls DRS
Max turned on “no more Party” mode
come on lando!
"Max baby, stay cool."
Well.
Box the car already
Drive to survive getting juice
Nooooooooooo
Dead in the water
WHAT THE FUCK
Damn. Rough for Max
Vindication for Honda; gearbox is designed by Red Bull
Anti stall?
Really unfortunate for Verstappen and RBR.
"Noooo, :("
Seems like he can't start it now :(
LOL wtf did Max just manually restart his car??
Only took 13 laps but F1 TV finally worked -_-
Max pissed
The Norris podium is back on the menu!
Well of course...
Shit that sucks
"well, now I hope Alex brings it home for a podium"
F for max
new wheel
Pls Bottas win
"Oh, shit.

I'm not even a huge Max fan, and I am feeling gutted.... That's not fair. I want to see racing!"
"Karma is a bitch, innnit, Horner?  😄"
This is a bloody shame
F
What's the issue?
Well this sucks
Can we FOR ONCE have a good pit stop strategy and gain the positions from Perez and Norris?
Fuck
FUCK SAKE
"Red bull taking out the only two people who could challenge bottas, fuck sake"
Come on RBR
Twitter RN... Ohohohoboh
Let's hop on Norris podium hypetrain!
Bruh...
Now that they've mentioned it. Is there any official confirmation on whether the calendar is going to stay like this or can more races still be added?
"55 laps to catch Bottas, plenty of time"
My stream died and came back with Max in the pits. What happened?
Fuck why man :(
Vettel catching Stroll on slower tires?
"No, no, no, no"
F
“Furious young Dutchman” is a bit of an understatement
f1tv back
F1TV working now
Yaaaawwwwwnnn
[deleted]
Racing points dropping off?
On the plus side now I can get points for Danny!
We need some rain.  Sunshower?
So will the Mercs lap everyone?
"f1tv slowly limping back to life, but the PLC has no sound."
What was the problem for Max's car?
Let's hope we have a good fight for 3rd place
Wait all that time to get 13 laps and get stopped by some fuck up with the car.
C'mon Honda I thought you fixed that shit!
"Well shit, Mercedes  1 2 incoming"
Bottas got a gap of 7 sec. he's flying
"If it was an issue with the systems it probably is in Albon's car too, so they probably won't be able to let him push in fear of the same thing happening."
Lewis on hard tires is usally in a different league come the end of the race. Could get juicy
I wonder what the hell they told him to do
Ferrari too slow to pass the Racing Point. But the slipstream stops Ricciardo from passing.
"""Valterri it's James, please make your next lap 7s slower, we need to protect the tires."""
C'mon Stroll
That helicopter shot from T3-T5 is just the best.
"Russell seems to be a lot better on Saturdays than Sundays - especially lap 1. He needs to improve, but it makes it hard when you drop straight to 19th and have no one to fight with."
Come on Danny Ric!
Ok albon let’s see it
Stroll has an engine problem?
Gio complaining that the engine is acting strange
Please please Albon get podium
[deleted]
"Valtteri, it's James"
"F1 needs rain/wet races every week lmao, otherwise in this era especially were just gonna get Mercedes domination."
Stroll losing power
Max will be back next week with a vengeance
"If you have F1tv (and it is working) and want to watch and hear the PLC, don't use the English language option, use the FX option and then you will hear the beautiful voices of Alex Jacques and Alex Brundle

edit (:40) seems that the FX has gone to only FX and the English option is quiet.

eidt (:42) seems now that it redirects only to the main broadcast, no PLC for now"
"Only chance Hamilton has now is if there is a SC, I hope Perez can get a podium."
Racing point holding ferrari is not what I expected in this year.
Wtf there’s 2 pedals brake and accelerator. Who knew?
"Engine problems for Stroll, and somehow still ahead"
Anyone have a fast flowing body of water?
Pack it up bois
RP with engine problems holding off Ferrari?!
"Lol Stroll has 'no power', but Ferrari still can't get past..."
"It's really respectable that Mercedes almost never has these issues that Verstappen just had, it's an amazing vehicle they made"
anyone got footage of seb overtaking ric?
Imagine Merc and Honda blowing up their engines and Ferrari taking 1-2 with their shitbox.
Vettel and Ric need to pass Stroll already!
Lmao at needing an explanation why a Racing Point can't shake a Ferrari.
"Of all the midfield battles in the world, wouldn’t have pegged STR v. VET as one of them."
How often do we have mechanical failures in F1? Is it pandemic caused and they were unable to check it on the car with not enough people at the track? Or just a thing that happened?
Very unlucky for Verstappen. Mercedes 1-2 coming...
Lmao Ferrari engine might be actually the best
This must be the least exciting Season Kickoff Race for a very long time..
Stroll with engine issues is still faster that Vettel. Damn.
ferrari engine can’t beat a RP with an engine issue
Williams back to usual as well. F1 is back!
That merc engine is having issues and Ferrari engine with drs can’t do shit.
RP having engine troubles on Stroll's car (team radio)
there must be something wrong with the ferrari engine. even before the engine saga they were not this slow doen the straights
A Racing Point with engine issues can’t be overtaken by a Ferrari - what year is this?!
Here's hoping we get a Bottas vs Hamilton atleast this year. No hope for any other teams.
Please close up Lando.
Ric out
I guess the only unknown left is whether both Ferraris get lapped.
Basically everyone is in F1.5 other than Merc.
It would be great if we could get an Albon/Norris battle for P3 but Im not sure Norris will have rhe pace
LMAO I JINXED IT
"Roses are red
Violets are blue
It's 2020
Merc 1-2"
Lol i work in a bar in holland and the whole place just shouted kut at once
"Str-Vet-Ric, the midfield battle we all predicted."
Fuck
"Is it just me or the advertisement hoardings around the track are a bit too prominent this year?
 
It's incredibly distracting on some camera angles."
NOOOO RIC
come on
Well at least we got F1.5 season to watch..
I fucking hate renault
RENAULT F
Lol cars dying one by one
So it seems like heat might be an issue for a few of these cars. Is it hotter now than in Australia at the traditional season start?
Danni ric
the first and no doubt not the last time we'll hear 'theres going to be an interesting battle for 3rd place'
aww son of a bitch
NOT RICCY
Ferrari truly looking like a midfield team
"And there goes RIC, wtf is happening"
Not Danny too
Renault back at it again
Hamilton is pushing hard rn
Noooo!!! Not Danny Ric!
The Renault is fackkked
Ric out :(
No not Danny :(
RENAULTTTTTTTTTTT
nt danny ric :(((
Fuck me
There goes danny
This raceweek keeps on giving ~~a new reasons for me to be disappointed~~
When a Ferrari can't pass a Racing Point with an engine problem....
Danny no
"Stroll, with an engine problem, is still faster than a Ferrari

Never thought I would ever type that sentence"
Lol the Racing Point can’t even get to full power and still smokes the Ferrari Jesus Christ
Wait Danny ric got issues now?
And Ricciardo's slow now. Not changing gear and smoking a little.
Danny stuck in 3rd gear.
"Ricciardo is fucked as well, what’s going on"
Renault dropped it
Fuck me :(
Renault not dissapointing either I see.
Damn Ric
Oh fuck off. Two favourite drivers are going out. I'm so done
holy shit a lot of retirements
Oh no
Danny Ric noooooooo
Maxiel for life
Yeah HAM taking three tenths out of Bottas every lap...
"When a Merc engine with a problem affecting its power still manages to keep a Ferrari and Renault behind, yikes. 

Also rip Ricciardo."
At least Danny and Max can go cry together I guess.
"20 cars, and ofc the one car which wouldve made the race interesting is out..."
And that's why you never buy french engines
Noooooooo
Ooof that Renault sounds like a lawnmower man
Covid infecting the cars
Oh no another engine gone
SEBBBB
Respect to Verstappens car for deciding to take the knee
No laughs at Renault now..
George Russel in P17!
Welp this is fun..
They're all falling like flies
Classic Renault
Stroll with engine problems but Vettel still can't pass him... Ferrari needs to do so much work.
DAMMIT
Everyone is losing power today
Stuck in 3rd.... oh no....
"Fucking Renault, absolute fucking shitbox"
"Smoke coming from the back of Renault.... Oh, shit."
Verstappen and Ricciardo both imitating 2017
"Renault problems, F1 really is back"
17 laps in and f1tv finally start working. Nice work /s
"On the bright side, we most likely get to see Albon or Norris on the podium today"
You have got to be shitting the bed
Danny noooo!!!!
Lmao
Had 1.Ham 2. Bot 3. Ver 4. Lec 5.Alb 6. Vet 7. Ric 8. Nor betting with my friends .... didnt expect Ferrari to be this bad in the race
gezz now Danny too ;(
"Well if Red Bull still had a Renault engine, they'd be out anyway. 

Silver linings"
Bye bye Danny Ric
Renault be like: we gotta beat honda
Oh my god
Hey I'm new to Formula 1. Is F1 TV worth it? I'm American and watching the race on ESPN. Is F1 TV that much better than just watching races on ESPN?
NOOOOOOOOO WTF
renault rip
Danny boy :(
I missed being this upset over a sport.
Fuck me silly
Handa and renolt being themselves.
Ohh ffs my two favourite drivers
NOOO DANNY
Ofc Ricciardo has bad luck again 😅
Its 2017 18 redbull renault flashback time
fuckkkk
Stroll dead too
At this rate Williams will be in the points!
just renault things... lol Ric
unfortunate for max
car number 3 stuck on 3rd gear
Danny Ric out and ocon cant get past a haas. Great going Renault
Jesus Christ
Guess Alonso won't want to come to Renault after all
"Just no luck for Ric, prolly looking really forward to next year"
FERRARI MASTER STRATEGY EVERYONE ELSE HAS ENGINE ISSUES
Everyone's engines are breaking RIP gran prix
can lando potentially catch albon? I don't think he has the speed to run the red bull down
cmon renault man
Nooooo Riccardo!! :(
Stroll is slow
"You know, Russell and Latifi still P18/19, but they seem to keep up better than usual."
Ah not dani boi
standart season opener stuff
That turn 4 uphill is mad
:(
Ricc is so glad he's going to Merc engine next year.
And Ric gets Renault'd.
Seb making moves!
Ferarri looked fast just then..... too bad it was against a car with engine issues
Danny Ric plssss :((
Nooooooooooooooooooo
Mercedes will win every constructor championship until they leave.
Coronavirus has mutated and jumped to f1 engines
Sure why doesn't everyone just get mechanical issues besides Mercedes
They‘re all switching their engines  into Corona mode
Mercedes with engine problems using last year's car>Ferrari's current car. That is a big boy fucking yikes
"Vettel clearly getting parts from the ""#2 Driver"" Parts Bin"
"lol, no car will survive this day. What the hell, lmao"
HOLY FUCK!
"Oh fuck Danny! That’s so
Shit"
"Crofty and Brundle are so dull, can we get Jenson in the box?"
WHAT IS HAPPENING
Oh ffs Mercedes are the only ones that will be running at the end of the GP
Ric out with mechanical problems? NOW f1 is back!!!
OH NO not Danny too!!!!  First Max and now Danny!  Someone cursed the circuit!
As a vettel and ferrari fan I will take whatever comes.
"Another year, another retirement from Max and Danny."
Oh FFS Danny RIC and mechanical problems my GOD
The way this is going we will see a Ferrari 3-4.
"Jeez another F, we just need another 8 more for Russell P10? 🤣"
Ferrari fan here . Now just hoping to see Nando on the podium...
Stroll is starting to struggle in the straights
Ocon pulling a decent gap on the Alfa
Who’s next to lose power
Stuff breaking unprovoked left and right..
Do we have an over/under on DNFs today?
Come on guys you has four months to sort this shit out.
Brill. Poor dan with a shitbox.
Let this nightmare end for Danny
Classic Renault
Stroll seems to be slowed down as well
What a messy race
Stroll's problem seems to have gotten worse as well
Danny noooooo
"oh great, Daniel with mechanical issues now...I fucking hate this 😩😩😩"
Lol renault put the voodoo hex on ricciardos car. Buh bye.
"It was all lining up to a beautiful fight, now Merc 1-2 zzZzzZz"
Dropping like flies
Danny Ric and Verstappen with engine failures. Where have I seen this before?
Race is slowly going to shit
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuu
I’m not sure about motivated if I had to use that Ferrari engine Crofty
"Oh fuck me, first max and now ric"
"Dang the reliability up and down the grid is shocking. Honda, Renault, Mercedes.... just waiting on that Ferrari to pop"
"Well, guess I’m going to bed now that Daniel’s out. Fuck Renault"
Mechanical nightmares
Fucking Renault.
"all I can say 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kujkQ63L_50"
Esteban overtaking Danny Ric
"Man the writers this season really trying to piss off the fans at the start. Who’s next, Lando?"
Did the engineers take a 6 month vacation?
Interesting to me that so many teams are having such massive problems
As commentator in my country said - Renault and Honda usual suspects
"What the fuck is going on?

Fucking hell"
Danny's gearbox just shit the bed...
Well this is the worst
Hello darkness my old friend
Please not daniel :(
One positive as a Ferrari fan is that our engine works so far at least even if it is slow
Fuck you Renault
U know wat..all cars will have issues and Merc will be the ones finishing 1 2..
Lec sai vet up ahead. Popcorn time
"stroll is done too, he lose too much time"
"Damn, still a long way to go. I predict more cars retiring."
At least we get another chance next weekend at a cracking race.
Good to see Renault are still Renault
Shit is hitting the fan
I'm going to be so sad if Ferrari is the midfield team that lucks into the podium.
Daniel is fucked wtf
WHAT IS HAPPENING
Renault engine failure.. nothing new here boys. It's normal.
that boy got no luck
"I feel gutted for anyone who retired today. 

Must really hurt more than others."
At least Ricciardo is leaving really soon
Poor poor Danny Ric
Oh ffs
Shit. There goes Dan.
"On the plus side, Albon should get a podium."
God damn!
the alfa paintjob looks sharp.
Lete see if valtteri can actually hold a race together with Lewis pressuring him
Can one of the top 3 blow up so we can have a Norris podium please
I beg norris podium
I was hoping for at least half way before the Danny Ric retirement. Shame his car broke so much earlier than usual.
[deleted]
"Bottas and Hamilton on another planet, holy shit"
Quit threat incoming.
Still weird to see a RP in 5th place
Tracing Point can copy mercs as much as they like - they still gotta make it reliable lol
Was Strolls engine trying to harvest energy while accelerating?
Rip Lance
We all know Hamilton is going to win this one. Excited for Formula 1.5 though!
Gio has made enormous leaps in one lap pace but in race day Kimi still has the advantage.
Is DP World what I think it is?
Under 6s!
1.09 flat
"Okay guys, whose the next person out?"
Hamilton attack mode is overwhelming
Stroll dropping down the standings really quickly now.
Of course it’s Grosjean.
"Lando's settling, still think he can get a podium here. Amazing how different the car is depending on fuel"
What a shitshow
Does Merc utalize the das during the race?
Romain being Romain.
 It’s just so funny when something bad happens to Haas because you know exactly what’s going on in the garage.
Williams moving up
Damn that merc looks slick. Plus they're pulling this gap out on one of the shorter circuits of the season. Imagine Spa and their advantage down the kemmel straight.
"Hypothetically, can Ferrari bring the last year's car for next race? Are the regs the same? I guess that wouldn't help tho because the engine is the issue?"
"Lance was harvesting going down the straight as Seb passed him, interesting"
Not even a third the way through and 2 technical failure DNFs and 1 loss of power potential DNF. I think we've got a few to come this afternoon.
Pierre into the points! Great driving by Kvyat too.
Stroll is done :(
Tbf Bottas is just about holding Hamilton back
Heat and altitude starting to affect the powertrains?
Vettel is getting so lucky that I fully expect Sainz’s engine to just explode at this point.
Three drivers out for issues within 22 laps. F
What is up with the cars woah
Stroll too
No way!
At least while slow no Ferrari engines is having problem.. yet ...
"Three retirements and we're not even half way through.

The fuck."
Really hope Valteri can go god-mode and win the WDC.
This isn't as fun as I hoped it would be 💔
I wonder why people are so surprised with Ferrari's speed if they have anniversary as the name of the car. Ferrari is always bad at anniversaries
NOTHING IS SOLVE
Watch ferrari get a podium by default because everyone bar merc in front have engine issues
There goes another one
Lots of Retirements!
"Lewis down to 6 seconds, presume he wants a good undercut"
Lol @ Grosjean
"I wanted a good fun start with Max competing the whole season, and an amazing first race,

I cry"
"Ahh, waiting months just for everyone to have engine problems.

Love me some F1"
Racing Point has a sexy garage
"Max retired 
Dan retired 
Stroll retired 
Ocon seems to have teething issues 
Ferrari demoted out of formula 1.0"
"At this rate, Williams is going to be top 10"
"Damn there are dropping like flies today, so many reliability issues"
"Grojean off, some things never change"
Both Williams not last!! Yay!
Hamilton catching up fast
Well Crofty I’m not so sure anyone is going to finish this race
At this rate Latifi may get a top 10 in his first race just for turning laps
rip Stroll
Rhe tires are not on
Fucking oof ma goof!!! Everybody’s dropping!
how
Its the 80s again
Mercedes engine?!?!?!?!?!??!!
Time for a Ferrari engine to drop haha
Man this race is sloppy
insert Grosjean crash joke here
"Man, it's like everyone who isn't a Mercedes fan is experiencing some kind of pain today."
Reliability issues everywhere...
Can Hamilton catch Bottas?
It's like watching the wacky races !
"Damn, that tyre got absolutely smoked when he went off."
Seems like Valtteri used a lot of tire life up in the early stage
Oh boy here we go
"The more I see it, the more I really love that BWT pink livery."
Lance retires too ? Wtf
Lol. Nice driving Romain. Hahahah
Okay let everyone have a car failure now pls
It feels good to be back! Even though Merc are 1 and 2 again
Williams is literally being pushed in front of the grid by all these DNFs.....
What is going on? Why is everyone going to the garage?
Its 2014 all over again
Lando's gap to Albon hasn't changed much which is pretty impressive for Lando. With some luck he could probably snatch that final podium position.
Verstappen and Ricciardo already on a plane to St.Tropez.
Two more down
I got a monaco 96 feeling bout this race.
Kimi looking racey
Stroll out
Ferrari strategy at it again
First Ferrari pit stop how bad will they mess this up
Absolute blood bath
We sure this is 2020 or some race in 20th century ?
"Ferrari: ""Quick, what does Mercedes do for pit stop? Do the same!"""
"Fucking Grosjean man, every time"
Ferrari trying to fake Merc into a pit xD
"Rip Honda, Renault and Merc, I mean at least Ferrari's engine is reliable so that's something"
"as a Verstappen fan what a miserable day... Shame that Red Bull couldn't figure it out.

&#x200B;

Kudos to Mercedes for being efficient and ruthless as always! lol..."
What was that from Ferrari?
"‪Ferrari Masterplan™️ was Sandbagging. Except they put Sandbags inside RedBull, Renault and Racing Point engines."
"We switch to Plan Master Charles, Plan Master"
"Dude sounds like a chicken:
>  “Box box box, be-gawk!”"
Ferrari does a Mercedes
I wonder what letter plan Ferrari are on now?
Awww not lance
"Ferrari trying to become Mercedes, I see...

Worth a try tbh"
Mercedes 1-2? Feel like I’ve seen this before
I didn't know Marcus was around the paddock this weekend.
Ferrari playing mind games don't worry
Ferrari is higher in the standings then they deserve.
Wait have Mercedes already pit??
I'm pretty glad that Ricciardo is going to McLaren next year tbh
Mag doing a great job keeping ocon behind him
Hamilton is coming....
Vettel on podium?
Ferrari 4th fastest car
Now we just need a Ferrari engine failure to complete the gauntlet
Anyone else getting F1TV turning off drivers cams and resetting?
No ricciardio
God I love the helicopter shots.
If Leclerc doesn’t catch and get past Perez I’m gonna lose my mind
At least the ferrari engines are reliable at this stage
going to be a dog of a season
"Dang, shouldn’t have jumped into this sub as a first time watcher  😂 I’m enjoying the race and the DNF’s are adding a lot of drama and suspense on who will survive, but then I turn to reddit and it turns out I’m suppose to hate this race and turn it off, lol"
Why do I still watch this??
"At this point, P 4-7 is the only thing keeping me interested."
We need Istanbuls turn 8 back purely for the sound the kerb make.
The curbs are shaking the cars to bits everybody
Damn tires look nicely ordered
everybody going to be out before lap 60 at this pace lmao
Why does Crofty have to mention the masks anytime someone is seen wearing one. We get it
Seb is in a great position to gain from pit strategy.
Lafiti is going to finish in the point at this pace
Hammertime
Lewis just gained 1 second
Ferrari lawnmower reliability 100!
Mercedes so far ahead on the shortest track of the season welp
Give it to Mercedes. Last year this heat killed their car. They fixed whatever issue they had.
Lewis is getting pretty close...👀
Is Latifi an F1 calibre driver or is solely at Williams due to the money he brings? I know he came second in F2 and I understand it has been an interrupted (pre)season so minimal driving in the car
Looks like Perez is going to segwayl to podium
Had to clean up a coffee cup that exploded... What happened too Grosjean?
Interesting to know there are no rubber bushes in the suspension. For some reason I assumed there would be.
Lmao the Racing Point car is so close to actually being the Merc that Bono's handing out reliability warnings to Lewis
That’s worrisome reriability if it PU wise jezz
"Poor Dan, I feel so sorry for him."
wtf
Jeeez Lewis
What the hell is that sound? (Ocon onboard)
Another Merc 1-2 with no one else really close. Maybe Norris will push for podium if Albon makes a mistake.
What's up with Bottas
"Bottas with 4d chess here managing those tyres.

Hopefully :/

Edit - word"
Wtf Magnussen??
WOAH THERE GOES K-MAG
Grosjean on wet tyres?
Magnussen wtf?
Lmao Haas
The new graphics they just did on Ocon's car were really good.
MAGNUSSEN DOES IT AGAIN
Lewis could win this yet Bottas just doesn’t have race pace
Whoa!
That Renault engine sounds rough as anything
KMag just completely forget there was a corner there or?
Albon is just 4 seconds faster than McLaren
Albon now 16 secs away from the lead ouch
Brake issues for KMag?
Curios how far Merc will be able to go on softs with their DAS.
"Damn, what kind of shitty brakes are those?"
"Ham and the heat death of the universe, two things you can count on"
What does the clock in the left mean? Next to Hamilton?
Safety car!
"just waiting for moment Hamilton overtakes Bottas so i can turn this off

Magnussen lmao"
HAAS go spinnnn
Why tf does Ocon’s car sound like that.
Steiner : vankers
Woah
Man McLaren doing well to stay pretty close to Albon's RB considering.
Hey Sky Sports can you please turn up the commentary feed the Renault engine is drowning everything out
what the fuck Magnussen
"I'm golfing while checking in regularly, and after each shot Lewis has pulled back another second."
What the fuck
Kmag's brakes are fucked
"I don't think the Honda actually had any issues, more like the board computer crashing. They tried solving it by changing steering wheels."
Atleast the renault sounds good
First sbin of the race
"Damn, no breaks?"
Haas and brake issues. Wow.
Nooo
Oh no it’s at CatHaassssssssTrophe
There's no way any of the top 3 take any risk to shake up the current podium standings unfortunately
Haas being Haas
Magnussen gone as well.
"And there goes the other Haas

Nice to see nothing's changed over the break."
Ferrari distracting everyone from the shitshow at Haas
WTF is that sound from Renaul :O
Wtf Kmag lol
"Damn so much drama!
Missed this so much"
At this point even Lightening McQueen is going to Dnf
Wtf is up with the mic on Ocon's car?
Is the Renault onboard mic inside the turbo? Lol
What the shit :/
I fucking love this season.
wtf
v⚓️s v⚓️s v⚓️s v⚓️s
Lewis just gonna destroy Bottas.
Haas just cant catch a break
Russel P13!!!!
Russell 13th!
What even is braking?
Guess its wanker time boys
"Why is the graphic for the hard tyre (Grosjean) blue in the on-screen overview?

Below the give the tires with their colors and there they are white like normal, but in the actual list they are blue. Weird."
SC
Haas
"Kayo pls where the fuck did my stream go, is this what it's like for people having to use F1TV?"
Wow.  What the hell.
Drive to Survive Season 3 here we come
Corner? What corner?
That Renault doesn't sound great
And another one
Welp there goes my whole fantasy team
"Russel upto 13th. Go get it, Williams!"
"SC!

This should get spicy."
Magnus’ Son lol
Will Hass survive this year?
Williams is going to be leading the Owners Championship at the end of this race.
oh my God everyone I like is getting blown up today. Rip Mag and Haas 😭😭😭
Bruh the reliability issues. At this rate Albon's gonna win.
That was a very neat bit of reverse parking.....
New G force showing graphic package is so slick!
What is that sound from the renault?
Haas always give us a classic on the season opener
"Drink everytime Crofty says ""Social Distancing"""
SAFETY CAR
Oh my god... Haas pls
A safety car gift for Hamilton.
I wonder how ahead Hulkenberg would've been if Ocon was taken by Renault. Ocon is so unremarkable.
"Rooting for Bottas right now, maybe he can mount a challenge over a short season."
Nice thing about F1: The cars close on each other much faster than Stock Cars and Indycars
Can anyone confirm that the Haas cars do in fact have brakes?
Safety car. Lets go!!
"Ooo safety car
Hammer time!"
Man. Haas hasn't improved at all.
And the second Haas spins
Bottas 0.8s slower that lap?
Aaaaand Hamilton P1 soon
Steiner in shambles
Kevin's brakes died. Woah.
Droppin out like flies..
SAFETY CAR!
CMON ALEX!
everyone pitting
Got to be a safety car
4 DNFs already
Haas LUL
yay satefy car
Anotha one
Williams almost in the points wooo
Wtf
3/4 drivers? at this rate we'll just have bottas by the end
How did he manage that
Watch Ferrari bottle this as well
See you guys in Drive to Survive next season!
"Even though Mag did that, was a pretty good move by Ocon there"
Haas has to be the most dissapointing team in F1
"So, what are the odds we see everyone from P3 down getting lapped?"
"""Don't forget he is a Frenchmen but he was born in Switzerland!""

Someone was waaay too happy pointing that out"
"What the hell happened there, he didn't even attempt to turn through the corner."
Here we go
Thank u safety car very cool
MAG is out! I’d love to be a fly on the Haas pit wall to hear all the expletives!
"That’s a saftey car, Hamilton is winning this."
I hoped for points for haas. I wish for them to be good again. For guenther!
This car is completely not rigged
puncture for mag
Safety car
"Do do do do do, another one bites the dust"
The renault sounds so bad
grinding renault lol
Haas are looking like bunch of Vankers right now.
Wtf was that
Here we go!
Make that four cars and the safety car is out!
It can be a fun season this year😩
This Haas team is such a joke lmao
"Damn, what a mechanical start to the season."
"Double stack to take the piss, aye?"
The Renault onboard sounds horrible!
F1 battle royale
Yes!!! Now Hamilton won't even have to work for it!
A safety car for that? Really?
Now things are getting interesting with the safety car!
Looks like Kevin was unaware and got spooked
This race is giving me pre-2012 vibes with all the random retirements
Very slick from Mercedes
Safety car
Fuck Mercedes is clean
"Stacking won't matter for Merc, so far ahead."
Great double stack.
"SC coming up, I’m sure."
Ted and getting interrupted
No breaks
FIA was bored.
HAAS farting out this turd of a race the day after July 4th is like the worst Springsteen song.
MAGS brings on the Safety car ! Haas always involved in the drama
Safety car for that???
"Fuck sake, worst time for a safety car for the excitement of the race"
And a free stop for merc to go along. Fuck me this race is quickly becoming unwatchable
Safety car saved Bottas
The merc livery looks so good
Jeez Bottas’s tires were chewed up
Safety car time. Interesting!
Haas spin their cars as often as other cars spin their tyres.
Very nice double stack for Merc
Great double stack
WTF was MAG doing???
That G-force graph is underwhelming. I want to see the precise ball!
It's actually kindof impressive to make an engine that sounds so bad.
What a shitshow. Safety car should give some opportunity for some good fights.
Absolutely clinical stops from the mercs
KMag: I must go... my people need me
SAFETY CARRRRR
Safety car for that? Not that I mind lol
Double stack?
Slight chance of Russell points bois
one stopper unless there's another safety car.
Beautiful from Merc
Cant wait to get overtaken by gasly at the restart
THAT WAS TOO CLOSE.
"Don't mind me guys... Just commenting because need to see new flair

Edit - Yep, looks good👌"
Double stop for merc
ALL YOU CAN EAT BUFFET AT THE PIT OANE GOOOO
Unsafe release Pink Mercedes
Cmon Lando.
Oh wow that was close
close one
Ocon is just *that* intimidating
"F1TV back up (if you weren't aware).

This is my first weekend of trying it out...is there any way to fix the audio not matching up to video? Audio is \~5 seconds behind..."
FUCK that was close
ouch.. close
Ripperino to this season as a KMag fan.
Wtf was that
Unsafe release there from perez
Mercedes didn't even have traffic in the pitstop
Love a good double stack
"Being a little critical,  but that's a dumb tyre graphic. Why have the pictures, a legend,  *and* words saying ""MED"" and ""SOFT"""
Gremlins in every engine today. That track temp is seriously treacherous.
fuck free race to hamilton i think
Fuck's sake Racing Point
Unsafe release
That’s gotta be unsafe release for RP
Holy fuck that was close lmao
That was definitely unsafe
Racing Point going with the “we can only defeat ourselves” approach I see
At least Russell might get a point if the DNFs continue
RP wth?
That's a penalty 100%
My god the renault sounds insane
unsafe?
Unsafe release  for racing point surely??
Ooo not very safe release there
"Ooof, unsafe release for Checo."
ffs
Unsafe release?
"Perez and Norris was close, my oh my"
Almost my boi Landon gone :'(
"Damnit Sergio, use your head."
WHAT THE FUCK ALBON???? I thought he was out 💀
Race on at Merc then.
Safety car to keep things a little spicy. Hoping Legreg can have a go at Perez.
Norris almost got dicked over.
Perez in mediums? Interesting.
Hamilton band Bottas gonna go for it after safety car release
"Praying Leclerc can get something done on the restart but honestly, Perez will just get the spot back. That Ferrari is a fucking rustbucket"
Over/under 5 laps for Hamilton getting to P1?
Bottas lost like 4 seconds in 3 laps before the safety car
*relieved sighs in Japanese*
Oof
Bono my tires are gone!
"Lando and Checo, oh so close"
Giovinazzi pitted I think
DAS USAGE
Oh shit
"Considering their pace on Friday, 9th and 10th is impressive for AT."
Dass ist gut
"Goddamn Haas, it's 4th of July weekend and this is how you come out?"
"""With only have the race gone, we still have half to go"" or sumfin'"
Dasssssssss
das ist gut
How much you wanna bet we get another SC? And who will be the poor bastard who brings it out?
"People must have thought about this ""das"" stuff before.."
Kimi is so unlucky with safety cars...
On which position was Stroll running before his engine issues occurred?
I know I’m a Lewis fan.. but if any race were to have the top cars crash into each other..
"Crofty should definitely say ""Safety Car Lights out and away we go"" on SC restarts"
Love the DAS use that the commentators didn't notice
Go on Lewis
"FFS Crofty, there is half a lap before the Safety Car comes in"
Anyone else think the tyre whisperer has got a shot at another podium on those mediums?
Let's go Lando.
Das ist DAS
Watching the onboard for the Mercs. DAS time!
where do they measure track temperature?
One car per team will DNF.
Russel P13
Perez is hoping to overtake both Norris and Albion and hope for a safety car?
HERE WE GO
Thanks Ted for not acknowledging Crofty’s DAS pun
lol poor bottas
Crofty and his DAS puns. :')
Gotta admit a cooling issue being the culprit for Danny Ric's retire isn't what I was expecting
Das Bööt
sheeeeet
Vettel ripperooni
NOT AGAIN FFS FUCK
"Unlucky for Bottas, Hamilton was obviously catching him every lap but he's lost over 2 seconds from the safety car"
Perez is pushing for that podium spot.
Noooooo
Bottas barely let the safety car get away.
NOOOOO SEB
Vettel. Sigh.
Nooooooooo
Oh no :(
"Lando! Haha

Edit: Whoops, it was Sainz!"
Seb playing ping-pong
Leclerc squirming
That was a tad dumb for vettel
Poor seb
Oh boy...
OHHHHHHH SHITTTT
oh dear. [insert vettel memes here]
Sainz taking out Vettel - again
"Fuck, that's vettel done."
LMAOOOOO NOOO
Welp
Wtf was that seb
Already playing the role of the good Ferrari man!
Saw that coming..
Mamma mia
"i knew it

i fucking knew it"
Ferrari oh my
So the renault can't even handle austrian weather?
Ahhhh fuck come on Seb
Oh Seb spinning...
HA
Seb wtf
Latifi is still that far away under yellow flags?
The Classic
Wtf is vettel doing?! What a dumbass
THERE IT IS
"Race starting again, interest to see if leclerc can stay with perez"
there's no way vetel thought that was going to pay off
Seb!
Sainz just said MY SEAT NOW.
"Gdam Seb, what is you doing?"
End me
Fucking hell just end me
FUCK ME
Oh boy....
Abismal performance from Ferarri today.
Perfect form
"ooof, vettel"
Faaakkkkkkkk
Unreal
Oh I already know what all the comments will be
Carlos closed the door
Vettel's fault here
OOF
Sbin
Oh Vettel
SAY THE LINE r/formula1
Vettel :(
Noooooo!!! Fck Nooooooooo!!! :'(
welp its good to be back i guess
This race is interesting nonetheless
Vettel getting personal with the guy taking his seat for next year lmao
Fucken hell
OMG
Oh dear Seb. His fault
"That's not your line, Vettel."
What is Vettel doing...
"KURWA MAĆ VETTEL, NOT AGAIN"
Jojo music intensifies
VETTEL SBINS
Nooooo
"Lol 2012 all over again, right?

right?"
Vettel deserves better
Wow
Russell points please
"Crofty makes it sounds like Bottas lost 7 seconds due to safety car... well done with your shitty narrative. It was almost 3 seconds, before the safety car."
no man
Dumbass move by Vettel.
Mystery why ferrari didnt offer him a new deal
S🅱️inalla
BROOOOOOO
SEB WHAT ARE YOU DOING
Couldn't get any worse
Lmao
That was too ambitious
Seb...
Lal Sainz
Dear oh dear
Trolololo
Poor Seb
Memes incoming
BUT WAIT THERES MOOOOORE
"Lmao, of course."
Seb :(
Vettel piruette not caused by him
Seb...
jesus christ
O seb
That was too optimistic
Why seb why seb just be patient
Russell P12 bois
Oh Vettel
"Ahh, cooling issues. Sorry I slagged you off Renault Gearbox. You're still shit though, so don't get too comfy"
"oh boy, classic vettel move"
So entertaining lmao
Lmao wow Seb
So everyone knew that ferrari was fucked from a mile away right? Didn’t try to back out at all
I swear Crofty nearly said pink Mercedes then.
"Russell is 12th, must have a nosebleed being that high up"
And welcome to the comedy zone
FFS Seb
Awful driving seb
"The more things change, the more they stay the same..."
SBINATTA
Oh come on...
SBINALLAAAAAA
Russel 12th!
I'm gonna make a business out of F1 drama bingo.
lol amateur driving from Vettel
Russell to 12th!
Damn we had to wait a whole 31 laps for sBinalla.
Sainz already secretly driving for Ferrari
This is gonna get spicy in a few laps
Seb diving soo far away!
RUSSELL P12
Classic Vettel
There it is
Did latifi have any problems or is he just this slow?
sooo.... Russell points?
You fuckers were salivating for a s🅱️in
Written in the stars
The Sbinalla jokes will never end
He sounded upbeat.. lol
"jesus christ, how did Carlos keep it together there"
Thanks the safety car
The sbinalla meme refuses to die
VET looking to already be spinning just before hitting Sainz
some things never change <3
too agressive from charles imo
THERE IT IS
S🅱️inalla
sbinalla lol
Russell points?
STILL ahead of latifi though lmao
Ah shit that’s gotta hurt for Seb
wtf
Vettel spins! Fml
There's the Ferrari we all know and love!
Pronto Sebastian?
"S🅱️innato!

(but come on Charlie, show us some magic...)"
"I left for a few mins and came back surprised there was no retirements. 

Seb spins out right as I was thinking that."
"Of course, Vettel, of course."
Vettle's fault
Ocon in points
"How do you say ""We look like fookn vankers"" in Italian?"
Ferrari’s woes continue...
"Well, where was Seb thinking Carlos was going to go?"
"Ohh here we go lol, Seb spins again"
Like clockwork... SBINALLAAAAAA
No business being there Seb.
Russell faster than Kimi
SBINALLA
"Cmon Seb, stop doing this to yourself.... that's some GP2 shit"
Absolute dive bomb into the corner by Seb
Why Vettel?
Russell up to 12 🤔
Back to back purples for valtteri
Vettel does what he does best.
"well, i think vettel will retire after this season... i don't believe he has fun spinning every race"
Can we just get in there Lewis already?
George is doing very well
"Mclaren's pace is just garbage. Damn you. 
It feels sad"
"Oh boi, the first of the season"
"At this rate Alpha Tauri are getting a 1-2, everybody ahead of them is just dying throughout this race."
Does Ferrari have the pace to get back in the points from 15th?
Seriously? Did the stewards watch that move? At the very least they should investigate.
Ofcourse you spin
Sucks lance lost an engine
"I wonder if Vettel will be able to pass Russell now, never thought I’d say this haha"
[deleted]
Good restart pace from Bottas. Maybe it was tyres that were causing his drop in pace before the SC. Lewis can still be a threat later in the stint though
Ocon in the points I had half a hope but I didn't think it would actually happen!
russel in 12th you love to see it
Fuck I missed f1 so much
Looks like the RP/McLaren duel will be fun to watch this season
"Russell in 12th, though I feel pointing that out may be tantamount to jinxing it..."
Big mistake by Seb unfortunately.
McLaren pulled a fast one on this sub
Is your F1TV audio not in sync with the Video?
Williams points is a possibility!
Last years Merc breezing past the rest of the midfield. YEP
Go for the gap I guess
Lando out here sliding around every corner. Absolutely no grip for him?
This race has been so crazy behind the Mercs
I like that camera angle on the run to turn 4
lemow
The onboard sound is giving me headaches this year :/
looks like copying last year's mercedes isn't such a bad decision for pinky team
Perez podium inbound
Will Vettel even get points?
That Ferrari engine sounds like my cheap coffee grinder
Mamma Mia. Ferarri is depressing
Bottas holding up well
Sainz getting airtime!
business as usual.
Bottas in Hammertime right now
Surely it's just a Perez hunting ground now
Perez!
here we go...
How many think perez and lando are going make contact?
Perez podium - unsure about the med tires though
Hmmmm
Hamilton does a new fastest lap 1:08.258
Hamilton within a second of Bottas.
Sergio looks faaaast.
Thanks Martin!
Fuck off Sergio! Leave Alex alone!
Jeez Albon already 4.5secs down
They try hard to limit Grosjean and remind him walls exist with that black/white
Lewis happier with these tires and possibly with more engine
"3-way fight Mclaren vs Ferrari, go go go !"
Fuck team orders.
mclaren bois pls
Vettel has lost his mojo.
Even without spinning the ferraris are so slow!
"HUD has back view now, cool"
Put the Russell show on!
Clon russel u can do it get the points
"Multi 21, Lewis."
There's still a point for fastest lap right?
Christ I didn’t realise Russell’s race post safety car go on
Go go Albon! Keep Perez behind you! Get that podium!!!!
That rear view graphic is sick
What does the black/white flag shown to Gro mean?
Russell gaining!!!
That is a cool graphic
That virtual rear view mirror though
That graphic is cool
Lewis always seems to love the harder tyres.
Yeah that halo graphic is sick
Loving this graphic
Alfa suck on the hard 😒
Checo with a black and white flag!?!?
Why they showing Leclerc rather than Lewis in DRS range on the leader.
This view with the rear camera on the halo is very cool!
"Lol, Norris with a 3 tenth advantage in sector 1 over Leclerc"
½ of the race completed & Leclerc is sandwiched by McLarens.
I am so tired of the German commentators at RTL....
Alpha Tauri > Renault?
"I'm loving that backwards view graphic, really cool addition."
"I hope they let the two merc's battle, give us SOMETHING to be excited about in the last half of the race."
Its HAMMERTIME
Sounds like my 2stroke chainsaw
Have Ferrari brought their RB Soapbox entry?
Good to see race direction is still quite inconsistent
Leclerc out of Norris' DRS zone.
Ferrari top speed on the long straight 301 km/h . The fuck is going on
Valtteri really loses time in that 2nd sector
Pretty good from RUS so far.
"Imo Vet was expecting Sainz to stay on the outside of Lec, had to lock up and avoid when Sainz decided to turn in behind Lec instead. Not totally defending the move but stop acting like he’s a total idiot. I’m just glad he avoided what could’ve been a collision ending multiple people’s races 

But yes haha spin man meme so funny"
Sainz already getting ready for his natural habitat
Gap back up
Yea let's not show the battle for 1st
Grosjean is at least consistent !
Has Russell overtaken anyone? I think he's ahead due to SC but can't remember
Was this a one stop race?
Hamilton putting down fastest lap after fastest lap.
"No one has anything for Mercedes this year, the gap is huge"
These cars sound absolutely disgusting jesus
The renault on board sounds awful
that renault sounds like my vacuum.
PLAN A
Can Perez finish the race with mediums?
Oh no
Chassis default?
Hamilton half a second faster than Bottas in S1 wow
Sensors.. what the heck
"That is a hold position order, surely"
Rosberg vs Hamilton vibes
Has Hamilton tried to use DRS yet?
Anyone want to take the long bet on one of the Mercs having a mechanical failure?
Bottas killing S2
Is Better unable to take over Raikkonen now?
"""Chassis default 2 - 1""... reminiscent of multimap 2-1 lol"
Oh uh.. bottas pitman better stop teasing me like this
"He's been 4 tenths behind for about the past 3 laps, Crofty."
Bottas need to use that Finnish calmness now..
James Vowells looks stressed...
"Formula Mercedes!

Incredible"
Mercedes seem to be in a race by themselves.
How is it that a Ferrari is having trouble catching up with a Racing Point?
RP went with the Medium and appear to be reaping the rewards. Why did no other car go with that same strategy? Am I missing something? Seems like Perez isn’t risking too much by going on Mediums instead of Hards.
Can we get some chassis assassins?
Next week they're adding spike strips to the curbs
What does Valtteri have to do to catch a break?
Yes keep driving on the kerbs pls boys
Ferrari have decent race pace tbh
I really dislike ziggosport commentating
 Urgent Chassis Default 2-1 = Mercs Multi 2-1
Hamilton told over radio it's a gearbox sensor.
Is this how Merc tell the drivers to hold position?
Guarantee if that’s anyone else saying that the sky commentators don’t find it so funny
still pulling away from albon haha
Hamilton's line through the hairpin is weird and then he's not getting close enough in the third DRS zone
"Ola Källenius „we might leave F1“
Tv director „say no more“"
Let them race ffs
What's up with the onboard audio today? Can barely hear the commentary or team radio...
This is the race that calls for more shots of the leaders instead of showing us that midfield battle that feels rather insignificant today. \*sighs\*
"No stay on the kerbs, please"
c'mon albon!!!!!!!!!!!!
"merc 1,2 for the rest of the year"
10 seconds between Mercs and Albon. Fucking hell
not really into the technical side of f1 too much what damage can a sensor issue do?
How many races are there this calender?
Every year is Mercedes 1-2 lulz
They'll be putting more araldite on those sensors next race.
"It seems in your anger, you broke the sensors"
"Only one thing can make this season interesting anymore, and... I hope it happens, even though i know it shouldn't."
How the hell did Seb end up behind the Williams?!
Who knew the curbs would prove more challenging than Ferrari
This race needs a gearbox problem in a merc
Mercedes is just unbelievable so dominate
Ooooh shit. Austria 2018 replay incoming
Can we get another shot of the spectators on the hill? It's a lot more interesting than this.
:/
"No overtaking... Come on, what is this"
looooool
Oooh they have to stay of the kerbs
James monkaS
"He, why don't you drive over the kerbs ^^"
Why try to depress the driver leading the race?
"I guess, with so few races on the calendar, they can't risk losing any points. But I want to see racing..."
Lewis slowing down?
God fucking damnit any car stressing Mercedes rn would be great
"VALTERI, ITS JAMES"
"Drive like it's Monaco, boys."
even badder
Ctrl-C Ctrl-V
my boy george infront of vettel now
When was the last on track fire?
LEWIS THIS IS JAMES!
Are there even other cars in the race?
Is Alex gaining?
Calling it now... A Merc will DNF... But which one...?
Hamilton and Bottas understand what kerbs are in the same way as Bill Clinton understands what sex is.
he should've told them both at the same time on a zoom sesh for some sweet $$$
GG.
Is anyone else constantly getting weird hieroglyphics instead of numbers in the F1 app timing 🤦‍♂️
"Stay off the curbs, boys! Everyone else, attack! Attack now."
Would love a recreation of Spain 2016 right now
"Is it just me, or lot things in F1 is failing on first race? Sensors, engines, electronics, brakes, live timing, gearbox in danger...

Is this the pinnacle of engineering or what?"
Just tuned in at half time in the Newcastle game. Is there nothing more exciting happening than Hamilton sitting 6 car lengths behind Bottas?
We really back to 2016 racing without the toxic environment.
These two to race to the end like this
So narrating what’s going on in the midfield instead of idk? JUST SHOWING IT TO US FFS
10s a lap lol
"""10 seconds per lap clear of Albon""

Geez these Mercedes are proper fast"
"Seb still not able to pass Russell, wow"
I love this shot
"The cars are fine, it’s covered up team orders"
Ham fastest lap while avoiding the Kerbs. 🤡
Imagine losing to a kerb
"If the Merc's actually are having slight issues, and it's not just a way to hand team orders to Lewis, than it's doubly tragic that Max had to retire. He's the only one that could have made this interesting."
They're still on the curbs! Jokers.
Even as a merc fan part of me wants them both to fail so we can get a closer race with Max throughout the season.
"Perez to pit again, or mediums to fall off a cliff?"
CrITicaL ISsuEs!1!
Lewis just full on riding every kerb
Get that pod kimi!
Parade mode
Well this race is now dead.
What a shame Max is out - that would been amazing
Show us Russell vs Vettel you cowards!
"OTHER BATTLES

YES

FINALLY"
God I miss the metallic blue of the Toro Rossos.
"So if Mercedes need to replace the gearbox after, they'll get a penalty next week"
"Is it critical, or is it the classic Hamilton ""my tires are dead, let me set the fastest lap"" critical?"
Who wants to be a looser? These boys need to push 🤷
"1.0+ gaps down the midfield as well, it’s going be boring for a while"
come on Ocon!
"Yes, some non-Merc cars on screen"
"inb4 Russell beats Vettel again, he already did it at Silverstone last year"
"Mercedes: WeArEhAvInGiSsUes

Albon: loses another 0.2 on a lap"
GOOO OCON
How are the other teams doing with the curbs? It’s freaking ridiculous that the Mercedes are taking slow curbless lines and the splits are the same.
GAS & KVY so consistant
"Believe me I am , the rosary beads are out"
oh man Romain not again
Apparently it just takes Ferrari being slow to see much more of the mid field
Bono my sensors are dead.
Lol Grosjean
Can we please see the race of people who are actually racing? It's been 20 laps now
"Safety car safety car safety car safety car, I think that could give Albon a chance with them having to stay off kerbs

Edit THANK YOU RUSSEL"
Come on Pierre
Valterri nooooooooooooooooo
If Alfa score a point here Williams are effed.
Has Grosjean actually crashed again
Ups he did it again!
Cant wait for a other race on the same track next week lol
Grosjean ahahah how fuckin pish are ye. Really.
Is vettel stuck behind George?
"Grosjean off track

F1 IS REALLY BACK BOIS"
ffs i forgot it was Austria again next week.
"Ah ok, knew I must have misheard that"
Grosjean off again
"Everytime Ocon's on, he can't seem to overtake."
If Albon would have the same update priority as Max he would be challenging Hamilton right now /s
Where is grosjean going?
Grosjean just chilling
Can we see one of the other 14 cars left in the race please? Thanks!
Grosjean is having a tough day in the office
Grosjean again?
"Grosjean off again...

Looking like a bunch of vankers..."
"Holy shit, they're showing racing!"
Jfc Haas lmao
Has that blue bit on the top of Renault's engine cover always been there? It looks awful
Nothings wrong Romain is trying alternate routes
"I am Romain Grosjean, and welcome to *JackHaas*"
Mercedes's  'critical issues' are another teams 'running just fine'
"Petition to have a separate TV broadcast just for BOT and HAM.   


We want to watch the rest of the grid"
Vettel can't even pass a fucking Williams lmfao
Spinjean back at it
Haas no
Grosjean again! Perfect
Grosjean doing a sunday drive
Haas problems continue
Who else is enjoying the formula Mercedes race?
Does Seb have damage? I'm surprised he's still stuck behind Russell
Grosjean mowing the lawn.
Oh bloody hell haas
Haas just can’t ever get it together
Fa Fuchs sake
Gro getting lost lol
Ferrari can't pass a Williams
Oh Grosjean 😂
"Ferrari and Williams fighting, just like the good old days"
lol grosjean
Wtf happened to Grosjean
Not good for Romain either
Haas having a shocker
Better not have just straight up said hold positions in the very first race.
Who would have thunk a Willaims would be ahead of a Ferrari? Being a Vettel fan has been tough...
Vettel is unable to overtake Russel
Nooooo Russell
Keep defending Daniil!!!
Haas used to be a serious team
OCONsistency coming through
Vankers
"Oh C""MON"
Nooo Geooooorge
they’re wankers not rockstars today
NOO RUSSELL
Grosjean socially distancing himself from the race track
Russell going really slow.
"Haas is gone, Russell is gone too"
Grosjean is trying to put on a show eh
George :(((
Latifi will still end up behind grosjean
GEORGEEEE
Noooooooooo George
NOOOOOOOOO. NOT RUSSELL FFS
Oh Haas
oh man what a shit race for reliability
Russell :(
RUSSELL NO
Russell problems now. PU overheat?
No the grosmeister.
"Haas back to 2016/17 spec with no brakes, sadly without the pace of then."
Haas failures are my favourite
Grosjean appreciating the freshly cut lawn by Bottas
More retirements....
Safety car again?
Noooooooo Georgeeeeee
Cars dropping like flies
Grosjean thinks this is rally
Jesus Christ as an American fan I’m going to miss haas
George :((((
ANOTHER MERC ENGINE DEAD?
Oooh Williams...
Vettel camera angle was awesome
George no 😭
NO GEORGE!
No George!

"Vettel got past Russel, oh my goodness me."
Ah fuck no russell
Oh look Russell is 14th. EDIT AND AS I TYPE THAT HIS MECHANICAL FAILURES START
Georgie. :(
Albon and Perez is definitely running it safe. Both their other cars are DNF.
RIP Russel
What the fuck is that race?
Nooo George!
Which Mercedes gearbox is quitting first?
I bet the Mercs are gonna make it safe and sound to the end lmao
GEORGE NO!!!!
NOOOOO RUSSELL
"Aww no, not Russell"
What the hell is Grosjean doing today? I like the guy but damn.
I don't know how many times this has happened and still no yellow flags
Nooo Russel
Gene Haas beginning the process of winding up Haas f1 right now after that
The Haas hype train literally has no brakes
Nooo Russell :(
Mercedes engines dying everywhere
God cars are enrolling like flys
"ALBON

THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO WIN"
Fucking haas
NOT LIKE THIS
RUSSELL NOOOO
Think that's curtains for the Haas project tbh
Grosjean taking in the sights
even russell out :( what is happening
RIP Georgiee
noooo george
Russell. :(
Not again
Noooooo :(
Russell radio - No power
NOOOOOOO GEORGE
Another Safety Car!
Yo the mercs aren't taking the kerbs in anger and still are around 4 tenths quicker than 3rd place Albon. What is this sorcery
Noooooo georgeeeee
Bummer for Russell and Williams.. :/
Pls Austria... don’t take Russel from us
Safety car
F George 🥺
Everybody breaking.
So basically if you finish you get points.
Russel nooo
Oof Bottas getting fucked this safety car. RIP
"Noooo.
What is this race.
Everyone i love is getting problems."
FUCK Russell retire
The merc engine is going left and right
"Safety car back out👀

Edit: yessir"
"Williams is a Yoke, a Yoke"
Engines dying everywhere
Grosjean clearly got bored of the track.
Gene Haas gets fucked by mature frenchman
NOOOOO RUSSELL
Wtf is going on
Latifi is gonna score points at this rate.
Williams retiring? I never saw this coming D:
Nooo Russel :(
Russell didnt get mercs note of staying off the kerbs
Haha Grosjean
"Aw, poor Russell. Great race from him, no points but it’s just what he needs to do to prove himself."
Oof another one
Wth is this clowncar race?
"Man, they're dropping like flies"
Not Russel! :(
I mean that's a second Merc engine failing...
SAFETY CAR?
Aww man come on :(
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day ruined
"Five cars. Williams is out, might trigger the VSC?

EDIT: Nope. We're getting the real deal."
Everyone to pit for softs
"Ohh we gonna get bunched up and Mercs apparently broken, gimme gimme."
That's gonna be a sc
Wait what are all this other colored cars? Are they also Mercedes? I don't think I ever saw these before
"Wait a second, we're racing here again next week?"
"Grosjean and Russell gone, this race is a killer, and I love it"
Is Latifi actually out of last?
omg all that smoke
At this rate we won’t be seeing Haas next year
"Oh, well there goes that chance."
What is going on with these cars? Everyone is DNF'ing.
LATIFI P14
Poor Russell. So much time to get it right and all the cars are falling apart. Now do the same for Mercedes please! We'll just start over next weekend.
RIP potential Russell points hype.
People are dropping like flies
Half the field is gonna get a DNF.
Another safety car?
"Mercedes 10 seconds ahead of the next car (while conserving the cars), Ricciardo and Verstappen dnf, Vettel spinning, and the most interesting thing going on is a conversation about kerbs... I think I’m done with F1 for good. 

See you guys next week."
Russell gearbox sensor as well?
This’ll be interesting
gg on winning the constructors world cup mercedes
Ugh.  What a great weekend for Haas.
So many reliability issues
Good Job Latifi! You are slowly pushing up!
Jawwurge :(
Oh that's good for Albon
Safety car
"6 retirements already, crazy"
Wtf
The scenes if we have enough retirements for LAT to score a point while RUS retires
ANOTHER MERC ENGINE CAR DOWN
Another double DNF for Haas in the first race of the season
Oh this just spiced this up
Gro exploring Austrian countryside
SAFETY CAR
Oh boy oh boy oh boy
GEORGE NOOOOO
Omg! Let's GO Albon! Take advantage of that Safety Car
Latifi > Russel confirmed
:( :( :(
Russell :(
YES SC
FFS Russel
Haas' season opener troubles continue.
One safety car please
Cars just giving up left and right
Bummer! George was having such a great drive today!
SAFETY CAR!! BOX BOX!!!!!!
"Mercedes engine: Stops working  
Honda engine: Good?  
Renault engine: Sounds ass  
Ferrari engine: Is ass"
Not the Williams! They are always reliable!
Ah fucking hell
Mowjean
Let the racing begin!
Albon....CMON FUCKING LET IT LOOSE OUT THERE
Aww cmon Russell was running so close to p10 on pure pace
NOOOO GEORGE
Noo Russell!
Another safety car?
Why are there so many issues? Because of the heat?
With safety car Albon got a good chance now!
Once again Ferrari with the best engine 💪💪💪
"Noooo. 

Merc might be in trouble now."
"light mood candles for RoGro

and no doubt Guenther owes the swear jar a few euros"
Lol mercs are kinda screwed
"Oh man, and here I was saying cars were more reliable. I guess such a long break took its toll on testing reliability"
He could have gotten a point :(
Safety car!! Yeah baby
Please Safty Car Please Safty Car
"Grosjean: You give me a flag for going off track too much? Fuck you, I'll do it again"
Another SC
Latifi  playing the turtle game.
OH BOI HERE WE GO
Albon or Perez for the win here. Wow
safety car???????????
Going to be a wild 20 laps
Not Russell. No!
So many retirements
Haas is just Comedy at this Point
Albon to win???
At least Rus will have the title of Virtual GP's champion
rip russel's chances
This first race is not going very well for these teams 😢
Mercedes is gone
George NOOO
Yo Seb pit for softs pls
"Grosjean is like 'Fuck your track limits, I'm going on safari'."
At least Nick will be in P14.
SC!
"Far out, motorcorona is a real thing"
Oh shit. This is gonna get wild
Carkiller Ring strikes again!
Nooooo George. :(
THE RACE IS BACK ON BOYS
Merc in TROUBLE
Its Hammertime now
Mercedes engine is fagile as heck and Ferarri engine is shit. Oh boy we're in for a season
Noooooo russell
Fuck me.... Safety car ftw. Go Alex!!
everyone here can’t stop bitching now it’s about to git gud
WOOO SAFETY CAR!!! LETS GO ALBON!!
Russell and Grojean? Sheesh.
THINGS JUST GOT MORE INTERESTING OHH BOYYYY
That's an interesting place to park the car...
Nooooo george
Oh god this potentially just got interesting
"Go on Alex, make it yours!"
Williams engine is done lmfao
Well that's interesting with Mercs issues. Could be an exciting finish.
Ooooh this just got spicy
Safety Car.  Pits for new tyres?
Ok Mercedes will rue this
Oh my god theres a chance of Latifi points. Very minor chance but an actual chance
Russell sacrificed himself to stop a merc 1-2
Might need to do something about the curbs..
Mercedes will just turn the car up for 3 laps and fuck off.
safety car?????
Perez P3!
such a good race from Russell! what a shame
The safety car is probably going to help Mercedes with their sensor too.
WILLIAMS NOOOO
Why no vsc? SC is useless here
Both Haas failed brakes.
Williams gives us one good thing today
Race leader: sensor issues
"Here's your shot, Alex"
Russell Driver of the Day for parking the car there!
Wow. Hopefully the sensor issues are legit.  That’ll make this interesting.
SC? Gearbox issue for Merc. LETS GO!
Can we get a Mercedes now? Please?
Poor George. Makes the fight up front interesting though if both Mercedes have to take it a bit easy.
aww russel :(
What a great first race of the decade. This is looking like a real banger.
Albon might do this!
This is gonna get exciting now :)
safety car is back again
Oh Albon pitted. This could bring some fireworks if Mercedes stay out.
Another one. Damn.
I called it. Another SC.
Why didn’t Charles put the softs on
### ~~6!~~ ~~7!~~ ~~8!~~ 9! Retirements... ###
Stay off the curb my ass lol
Oh yes Russell!
"Pinnacle 

of

Motorsport"
Come on Albon! Time to shine now
They are dropping like flies!
"Looks like albon pit times are bugged, 2nd time we can't see it"
Safety car making this interesting
"Yesssss

RBR and RP pls challenge Merc bby"
Did Perez stay out?
"Albums first win coming up here

Edit: I'm not fixing it"
Little Latifi overtaking the POGPR. Not cool at all.
A race fitting for 2020 indeed
Theses cars are dropping like flies
Do we have a race? maybe?
All we need now is Ferrari pu to fail and we will have one of each manufacturer failing.
OH BOY THIS IS GONNA GET GOOD
"Safety car it, might bring some interest in the race."
Comon Albon my man you can do it
now you have officially carried it too far buddy
Mercedes not pitting?
That track is hungry for blood
Russell have the gearbox sensor issue that the Mercedes pitwalls been on about?
Oooo redbull on new tires
Another DNF? Damn..
HERE WE GO
Another safety car! Spicy.
Al on on soft.
"Here we go, softs on!"
for fucks sake. Russel was in front of Vettel
Grosjean being a bit shit is a regular feature these days
"Perez not pitted, Albon, Norris and Leclerc have pitted.
Albon used softs
Norris new mediums
Leclerc new mediums"
"At this rate, it will be a Ferrari 1-2"
George doesn’t deserve this!
If anyone thinks Albon or Perez can seriously threaten Hamilton or Bottas they are delusional.
"Both Haas, Danny Ric, George out, Seb spun... its all going wrong for my rooting interests."
I would pay to see Gunther Steiner's face right now
"Perez hasn't pitted, seems risky."
"Poor Russel, that's sad"
"Latifi has to manage to make up this 30 seconds with this safety car, yeah?"
McLaren are second in the Constructors championship.
Latifi could have a horrendous race and pick up a point from retirements...
Why the hell hasn’t Perez pitted? He’s on the worst tyre possibpe
"Will Perez pit for fresh tires? I think it would be worth it. Plenty of laps remaining.

edit: PEREZ QUE HACES?"
Take your bets on who will drop out next!!!
McLaren taking a gamble with Sainz here.
Last man standing
Hamilton and Bottas played themselves. So greedy!
and another one bites the dust
Alex can still win this 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Fresh tyres for albon and Norris
Ohh spicy
Safety Car the star of this GP
Ffs!!!
Will Albon keep these softs alive?
Interesting race though.
I'M SEETHING
things getting saucy
A safety car! Yeah baby! Let's go wheel to wheel. Get things interesting.
A Williams retires? shocker lol
Perez P3 lets goooo
Williams 5th retired car of the day!!!
Merc got fucked with that SC
NORRIS ON FRESH TIRES PODIUM HERE WE COME
Interesting tactics from RP
Russell doing god's work. Shame that so many on here have told us that they have tuned out so will miss this.
"Yay safety car, maybe something interesting can happen at the front this time"
Mercedes not pitting?????
Just wish they'd throw softs on for Seb for the last 18 laps and let him have at it. Nothing to lose
"Haas And Brake Failure, Worst Match Made In Heaven"
Albon with the softs. Omg
"The Ferraris can only overtake cars that drop out of the race, what a pathetic showing."
Is Mercedes using Perez as buffer to Albon with fresh Tores?
Well that escalated quickly...
Mercs imo are exist to quick even with problems
Austria really hates the Mercs
merc powertrains not having a good day
Albon gonna win now?
Surely perez has to pit
"So, Ferrari are the only team so far without engine problems?"
Damn Russell really had a chance at points :(
Mercedes stays out!
2 Merc PU down holyshit
We want more! We want more! (Retirements)
This will be interesting :D
"Albon on soft, game time!"
YESSSSS WATCH OUT MERCEDES
Ehm.... This could be Albon for the win guys.....
"Albon fresh tyres, p4"
This is 2014-level of reliability today!
Merc power units dropping like flies
Albono go !
Nooooooo not Russell!
george sacrificed his race so we have an exciting last half of the race
ALEX FOR THE WINNNN 🥳🥳
Over/under 10 cars actually finishing? Jesus what a massacre
Why would you go on used softs for 18 laps?
This race is more up and down than a teenager's pp
Latifi is only 3 or 4 more incidents away from being in the points
"Ohhh, safety car comes in to save the race maybe."
Would Albon keep pace with soft v hard?
Ohh this could spice things up a bit!
ALBON MY BOY LETS GO
"With the Mercs suffering mechanical issues, I can’t wait to see these last 20 laps."
AGAIN FUCKING MERC NOT PITTING
How many cars are gonna get retired before the race ends?
Perez on podium
Ocon gained a place there
Oh this could be good...
Go Albon
Did Checo pit?
ALBON P1 HYPE
Albon hype. Pls save us
Why didn't checo pit???
Bottas' gains melted away with that safety car :(
"Wait a minute the Mercs are not in, umm what?"
Merc are in some serious trouble here now
"Come on, Alex!"
Perez P1 incoming
Please don’t be aggressive Perez you cannot challenge soft tires.....
Holy shit this is some game of thrones shit. Wildest fucking start to 2020 we could have hoped for
No reason to take medium over soft with 15 laps to go
This will be really fun to watch if Albon can pull this off.
Surely pink merc will be kind on restart
Albon gonna pull a ricciardo China 2018?
"Shit, didn’t Haas get the brakes sorted back in 2017?"
👐👐 take my energy Alex
Woah! When did checo pass albon?
Oh god merc v merc v merc
please latifi pull something out of your ass i am begging you
Perez tyres are gonna die
Why not pit one merc?
OH it's going down.
Did Mercs decide not to pit or were they already past the entry when the SC was announced?
Did sainz get fucked?
are Merc going to fix the curb issue by next week?
Old Mercedes will hold Albon up
Checo podium hype Choo choo!!!!
Ocon only has to defend now
Interesting that Ferrari went for mediums. Weird for Perez not to pit.
What a pity so many decided to tune out. Must be too young to remember the wise words of Murray.
Them sneakers in the field
It's Mercedes domination so far but man this is still spicy
Now this is exciting!
Albon going for top spot!
Why is Perez with those old mediums not in the pit?
One Merc will not finish
Lol they where still pulling away with the engine turned down crofty.
That safety car sounds incredible. Kinda sad it sounds better than the f1 cars
COME ON ALEX
This could go to shit for the Empire...
Fuck I missed this!
"Albon and Norris will pass Perez with ease, can they get after the Merc's, if they Mercs can't ride the curbs and Albon can (if Verstappen's failure was something else)."
 let's see if the 2019 Mercedes is quicker than the 2020 Mercedes.
They have cars for next Sunday?
What a return race man
Seb looking tired
That's a proper VIP lounge
THIS IS GONNA BE SO GOOD
Why Merc didn't change tyres??
"Alex, let's go!"
"Safety car will be the driver of the day for me, this race keeps getting better and better"
Heck yeah. Red Bull always play an aggressive strategy in restarts.
ALBON LETS GOO
Albon's got a chance here
Oh my this is going to be tasty
The only hope left to have is that Bottas can make the WDC interesting.
Albon and Perez to push the mercs till they ruin their gearboxes. Cmon 2020. Make it happen.
"Brilliant! After the ""GEOOORGE!"" meme during all the sim-racing, a George Russell-made safety car might gift Albon a first win in F1."
Russel is out so now I'm fully committed to Perez gogogogogo
Genuinely can’t wait for this end
Seb please don't hit kimi on the restart. Alex also deserves a podium I hope he gets it
"""we do think he deserves a podium, just not enough for a new wing"""
COME ON ALBON!!!
"Albon on soft, Mercedes with issues, this could become interesting!"
Hope albon gets his podium this time
Albon and Norris on fresh tyres but Merc stays out. I guess  reason is they couldn’t treat both drivers equally. Might prove costly for Merc eventually.
Red Bull must be thinking at least Alex should get fastest lap point woth the new softs. Even if the Mercs survive to the end.
So is this SC phase now putting the Mercedes in the clear because of the stress reduction?
Checo would be smart to let Alex through
Guys this has Spain 2016 potential!
"Petez dude, don't make it too difficult please thanks"
Those seats fucking stink
China 2018 ricciardo vibes with Albon
Checo can ride the tail of Alex to the Mercs and create some serious problems
"Sainz pitting late. Would have been better off staying out and keeping Lando and Charles behind, maybe? Would have been doable with a bit of coordination from the pitwall."
Alfa might get a point. Was not expecting that to happen.
Incoming spice pls
"Mercedes with reliability issues? When was the last time we heard that, 2018? 2017?"
I don’t think we’re done with safety cars today sadly.
Valtteri it’s James inc.
"If Norris or Perez can pull off a win because of the Merc issues, that'd be the first win from a non Merc/Ferrari/RB team in the entire turbo hybrid era, right?"
"Safety car and russell ftw, making these race intresting."
What a spot to watch! Yesterday there were only two guys up there.
This is gonna be pure 🔥🔥🔥
Here we go.
"The marble bits going into 1 at this point in the race are the size of golf balls, my god"
Anyone else feel like Albon is going to be over-eager and hit someone?
"I hate, HATE that I missed the first fifty laps. Is Vettel about to finish last of the finishers on pace??!"
Gasly is doing well today
When was the last time we had a podium without a Ferrari or Mercedes? Very real possibility today if the Merc gearbox issue holds them up after the SC
"Kerbs, the real winners"
good god am I clenched for this restart
Safety car in
Take a chance roll the dice make a roll roll critical roll roll a critical roll
Perez the podium poacher ™
[deleted]
"Mercedes 1-4, maylander, bottas, hamilton, perez"
"If he can just keep his car from blowing up, will Latifi get a points finish on his first race?"
That is 6 total cars gone. The season start must be so frustrating for the mechanic’s
"Racing Point seems to have thrown out the race, without this pit-stop. Let's see what happens and hope I'm mistaken"
"Come on Albon/Norris, make it happen!!!!!"
ALBONO FOR PODIUM
Goooo Albon
Tv's Will probably a hot selling item in Italy. Lots of families threw theirs out of the window probably.
albono for the win pls
This is spicy again
"Bottas playing restart games, love it"
Lmao bottas STRAIGHT over the kerbs off the restart
GOGOGOGO
Bottas brake slammed him. That was pretty alpha.
Austrian rednecks?
This still shows that last year's Mercedes is still better than the rest of the pack with Pete in 3rd.
"I'm new to F1, watched some recent races during lock down, but 6 cars getting DNF'd in perfect weather already is certainly unusual right?

Edit: Make that 7"
Yellow why?
Yellow flags?
Go Albon! Go Norris!
Alfa Tower-y
"They should probably tell, the safety car to stay off the curbs...."
Latifi went round Kimi
This is going to be interesting
come on albon!
"C'mon Albon, can't get better than this for you"
Did Kimi spin?
Albon on the podium? Let’s go!
Bottas just drives away straight away..
What a race
Another safety car???
Literally doing the topic thunder ‘survive’ with Perez now
Nice one albon
WAY TO GO KIMI
come on Charlie
Oh no not kimi
ALBON
Albon podium is happening
Another one
Wheel fell off?
If you told me last night that a Racing Point win is decently possible...
Gg Alex!!
Oh kimi
Force India failed everything they could lol
DID ALEX GET PEREZ ALREADY
ohhh Kimi
oh no Kimi :(
Holy shit this race.
Nooo Kimi
WAR ALEX!!
"Ouch kimi, main straight too"
"I wonder if both Mercedes were past the pitlane when the SC came out. 

Otherwise they've dropped the ball majorly"
Did bottas just start and stop ever so slightly?
"Perez has no ice, locked up already?"
WTF lmao
Raikkonen out
This race is wild!
No... Kimi
Banger pass from Alex. Too bad about the SC.
Who is third now?
KIMI NOOOO
What is this race anymorw
What a pass by albon.
Kimi lost a wheel????
What a race....
L
Will anybody be left at the end?
Absolute carnage this race
Kimi nnnoooooo!
Jesus Christ another car gone

What on earth..
17 laps for albon to come third!
Only 13 cars running? Damn.
ALBONO LETS GOOOO
Ohh ffs albon's luck is absolutely dry
What a move from albon!!!
No way. Wankers
Holy shit another one
"Dream scenario or nightmare scenario: Albon takes Perez into Hamilton, knocking all three out. Bottas wins but a big fight for 2nd"
FUCK
Holy SHIT
Nevermind. I thought Latifi overtook Kimi. He crashed. Hope he’s okay
Nicholas Latifi is up to P13.
Another one
"Safety car, again? Wtf?"
What is this race.
What is this race!?
What is this race my god
What a nuts race
What a launch by BOT

THE F*CK WAS THAT???
Peepeepoopoo
Oh Kimi
"Hahaha, don't tell me a safety car again!!"
ALBON JUST FUCKING SENT IT BUT ALL FOR NOTHING
Mercedes is #blessed
"Safety car is off!!!

Aaaand safety care is back on"
New safety car!
Whaaaaaat
Another one bites the dust
The front fell off.
F1 Endurance series
HOLY SHIT KIMI
7 cars out! What a start to a season
Where were the cables keeping that tyre on? That's dangerous as fuck
Oh great - another SC
WTF HOW DID THAT HAPPEN
Arrghhh!
Kimi:(
FOR GODS SAKE ALFA
Wow
That retired list looking thick
This isn’t Baku?!?
How tf does that happen
Wtf what happened to those tethers!? This is unsafe as fuck
CRAZY
And anutha one
This was dangerous as fuck
That tire just head out
Holy shit I've never seen that.
What the actual fuck is that
This is my first live F1 race and what is happening
I sware if Latifi gets points...
This is just a big shitfest
Will every team lose a car by the end??
NOOOOO KIMI!!!!
That was weird
Albon unlucky
Perez win!!
Yikes!
HOLY SHIT THATS DANGEROUS
The front fell off
What the fuck is this race
You get a safety car! You get a safety car! Everyone gets a safety car!
I haven't seen a loose wheel since Malaysia 2016
"What is this, Monaco 1996?"
2020 strikes again boys
These kerbs are deadly. Holy shit
2020 is such a fucking weird ass year holy shit
KEEP THE CHAOS GOING
That was a fantastic noise coming down the straight
The tire is just chillin lmao
OMG Raikkonen
Alfa in the mud
What a shitshow
The fuck happened Kimi??
What a shitshow. I love it
tire just pops of lol poor Kimi
My...god
Wtf happened there
LMAO WHAT IS GOING ON
Fuck these safety cars
Poor Albon. He can’t ever catch a break.
The cars are all over the place
lol what the fuck
Wtf. Kimi? I don't think I've ever seen that happen before.
Holy shit the tyre flew off
Unsafe Release kimi
No Brundle the tyre wasnt on properly
Lol what the hell was that
Bruhhhhhh
That might be a fine
Just hate it when that happens.
I see we're going for the Singapore ending to this race
This race is a shitshow
Nooooo Kimi
GOOOOOOO ALEXXXX
"someone tell me when its ok to be excited again, Im clearly bad at judging this myself"
Bruh what the fuck Alfa
Never seen anything like that
that is fucking **dangerous**
Thats one way to try fend off vettel
Yaaaaaaas mon the safety car
you can’t make this shit up
And ofcourse kimi goes as well
Did kimi pit recently?
"Iceman barely got above a stern tone for that.

*He lost a wheel*.

Never change, Kimi."
"I don't think it's supposed to do that, ngl"
Holy fuck Sauber didn't properly tighten that tyre?
Dude.  What the hell.
Um I don’t think that’s supposed to happen.
Why would Kimi go back into the track?
Wtf happened to the tether?!
oof
*Such a tease*
At this rate latifi will get points
"Somebody said it right, at this rate you will get points just to finish."
WTF IS THAT ISSUE?
Jfc what happened to the tether!?
How is that even possible? I thought tyres couldn’t fall off like that anymore
Loose wheel nut ?
It just fell off?!
Kimi - GIVE ME THE WHEEL!
"To finish, you have to finish first"
The wheel came off! Damn!
The heck is going on with these cars they're just blowing up!
Williams will get points at this rate
Another one?!
The wheel decided to yeet
Some cars are made so that the front doesn't fall off at all
The only thing that can lead the the Mercedes is the safety car.
What the fuck
"Holyyy shit, thank god for the halo, nothing happened but still"
Oh fuck sake.
Unsafe release wtf
Kimi is the most relaxed person on that grid. Even without a tire lol.
Clown fiesta
Jesus those tires flying remind me of a scary time on Formula 1
Well that's going to take a while to clear
THE TIRE JUST FUCKING CAME OFF WHAT THE KERB
Norris & Leclerc rolling that dice
Kimi nooo
Great move by Albon
What the hell is going on......
Just when you thought it was going to be an interesting finish
Singapore flashbacks
Loose tire faster than Haas lol
7 retirements far out
Fucking Alfa didn't put the type on properly. FFS
What are the most number of DNFs in a not-raining race day?
They see me rolling
Should albon not get that place back?
But now Albon is straight behind the Mercs. Not a lot of laps left though once this is cleaned up.
What the fuck is this race
*bwoah*
Amateur hour at the Big Circus.
Poor Kimi! Even he can’t drive sans wheels
The tire...came off....the mount....wow....
"Did it break off, or was it not put on good enough?"
Absolutely fucking amazing overtake by Alex
"Oof, Alfa never fixed the tyre properly"
Latifi is gonna score points at this rate
Fuck
Wtf is going on this race
Oh no Kimi!!!
What dry race had the least cars finish since US GP 2005?
Kimi front right tired of this race too
Alright that tire frisbeeing like that for a moment looked cool af.  I'm glad it didn't go anywhere dangerous after.
Kimi is about a mile away from the closest person.
The front(s) fell off!
Front fell off.
Anyone in for ACC in Spa afterwards?
The tires are literally falling off of cars. What is happening
Does a racer actually have to finish the race to get points?
What the hell is happening is this race ahah
No Kimi!
Anything is possible at this point
Tyre has gone home to its people
Unsafe release from pits then for Kimi?
Latifi's going to get a point...
That's something I haven't seen before
"Lol, the tire is tired of this race as well."
Latifi going to get his first point before Russell at this rate.
Holy shit Raikkonen
The was yellows at the first corner what they talking about
Latifi might get points just by surviving!
Was that the kerb?
That’s not a good look Jesus Christ.
That’s gonna be a fine isn’t it?
*Cursed year*
This race is a complete yoke
Whoops lost my wheel
Last man standing
What the hell is this race
Wow 3 red bull appeals in as many days lmao
these kurb really going to kill all the cars
"Welp, time to make jokes about Alfa reliability!"
FIA is secretly testing elimination races
Dramaaaaaa
This single race making up for an entire season of drama
LATIFI UP TO 12Th
Albon :(
This race is an absolute disaster.
The front (tire) fell off.! This is a wild race
That was really close to Vettel holy shit
rate the season opening race with one word
Imagine if Latifi gets points in his first race just because 10 other cars decided to peace out 💀
Formula Shithousery
Kachow
"That wheel looks lonely, someone give it a hug."
What goes through your head when your tire leaves your car behind at 100mph
Surely that's a fine for the lack of effective tether?
Bets on 10 cars to finish the race?
Did Kimi just pit?
Imagine if Latifi gets a point in this race but then Williams scores no points in the rest of the season.
I didn’t see anyone on the corner waving a yellow when albon made the move
Are we gonna get 10 finishers?
Crazy race
🎪
NO GIMI NOO
That tractor was HAULING ass to get to RAI's car.
"this race reminds me of the races from the early 2000s where there were so many retirements lmao, great throwback"
This SC will take so long again
"Kimi: ""Where the fucks my wheel?"""
Feels for Kimi
SERIOUS LOAD
Kimi does not have very good luck with tires does he...
That soft strategy is absolutely paying off
[WOLFGANG PASS AUF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo05D-_k1d4)
This race is saved by the safety car
We might get no top 10 today :D
"Alfa were amateurish last season, I'm not surprised at that tire. Really disappointing from them."
Could this all be because they've had a lot of time for innovation and very little time for testing?
Hurry up ffs
Everyone shut up about Albon. If he made the move before the sc came out then Perez will get a penalty. Simple.
There seems to be something wrong with our bloody ships today
Pure chaos is making me feel a little less depressed about Seb's race
Oooh... okay then.
"Cmon Niki, get in the points lad"
Surely SC in this lap?
"RAIs front right tire ""aight imma head out"""
Mercedes 1-2-3 seems inevitable now.
He sounds really upset.
"Mercedes on their issue: 'Well it is fewer racing laps, so that helps.'"
What are they doing with albon!?
yay 4 albon
That Renault turbo sounds like a shrieking hell hound.
Latifi might get a point before Russell at this rate
"Albon p3, Perez gave it back."
Why Sainz didn't pit earlier or when Norris pitted ?
Seb is on fresh softs on front of Kvyat and I still have zero faith he'll get past
Cmon Alex. Chase these Mercs down
albon will win
How long does it take to clear the track? Come on....
"SC in, come on!"
C'mon Albon..you can do this...
how did gio fall back to last place?
That was a fucking beautiful overtake.
Albon in the box seat
Mercedes 1-2-3 through most of this race
COME. ON. ALBON!
"Hasn't been much debris for any safety car, what the hell is taking so long?"
Thought the yellow flag was waving when albon overtook Perez
"Albon on fresh softs vs wounded Mercs on old hards, ooh this is spicy"
"So this will be the battle royale race, interesting..."
Someone wanna explain why ocon is still on Hard tyres
At least p2 or bust for Albon. 11 laps to do it
Alright Albon and Norris. You’re our only hope!
ALBON GONNA PODIUM!! <3
"go on merc boys, hit those kerbs for us"
Now we just need the Mercedes to blow up.
Hoping for Norris to push
10 mayhem laps fuckers
"Thank you, finally. Now let’s PLEASE finish these last laps under green."
GREEN GREEN GREEN
Albon for the win? let's fucking gooo
Safety car engine sounds fanatastic
Poor Kimi
That was a bit close!
I hope either both or no Mercedes fail
Let’s hope there will be more than 15 races.
They got close to the SC
Imagine it was raining 😏
Jesus the SC was still out there :S
alright so who's crashing next
Buckle up boys
Come ooon 10 lap sprint to the finish!!
Could be absolute scenes here with Lewis and Valtteri on old hards and Alex on new softs. First P1??
Merc is happy they could show off that ugly new decal on their safety car.
Cmonnnn let's dial the yakety sax up for the last laps
Kimi ready to retyre
You think both Ferraris would finish in points?
Go go go go
When crashes are more interesting than the racing itself then
"Man if Merc's issues are legit, I feel like Max could've at least snatched 2nd. Hope Albon can pull through."
Hahaha ham!
Albonooooooo noooooooo
Brazil all over again

It's happened again!
"Red Bull with no points today, fuck."

Alright Perez is now our champion.

The Laff-a-Lympics didn't have races this wacky... Holy Jesus.

Räikkönen's tire be like: this car is so sht I'm out

Eeehhhhh that's on Lewis I think.
Albon gets screwed again
Racing Point or McLaren podium incoming 👀
What did he say?
So Lewis never crashes unless it’s Albon
HOLD FAST RACE THREAD
fucking flashbacks
ham penalty
:/ there was hope
I'm so glad F1 is back!
TWICE
spoke too soon
WHAT A YOKE
"""WOO FUCK YEAH- shit"""
The BLESSED CURSEEE
F Albon
Phew
Come the fuck on
Latifi point Choo choo!!!!!!
Nah he left plenty of room. U don't concede that place
No way that’s enough space for Alex to have got passed
ALEXXX NOOOOO
NO FUCK
NO FUCKING WAY
That's grim
Again?
GUTTED.
Willing to exchange a Hamilton loss in exchange for a Landon podium please.
Mercedes 1-2-3
Lewis....
The Brazil move was a total divebomb. That's more 50/50.
OMG
NOOOOOOOOOO FUCKING HELLL MANN
big sad bois. Albon had so much time!
Bot Perez Nor
Balls
the split second happiness turn to disappointment in the red bull garage
Pierre in sixth
C'monnnnn
GOOOOODDDDD FUCKINNGGGGG DAMNIITTTTTTTT
What the fuck is this race?!?!
Brilliant day for Red Bull...
Did Albon shag Hamilton's mam or something?
OH SHIT.
Come on Norris! Get in there.
GEORGE !! GEOOOORGEEEE
BRUH
I hate everything
FUCKING HELL
Omfg
Pls Norris podium
Mercedes 1-2-3.
Imagine Hamilton doesn't get the 34 straight points because of that
If Norris wins it wow
unbelievable
Just cmon Perez
So.. curbs time?
Does lewis' front left wheel look slightly at an odd angle?
PENALTY
If anything Horner is gonna be pissssssed lol
NOOOOOO
lando p3 please
OH NOOOOOOO THIS IS INSANE.
NOOOOOO
Albono was ahead.
Well if this isn’t the biggest fucking anti climax imaginable...
Interesting tactics.
The bad luck of redbull today..
Lando is our only hope now
Yesyesyesno in the RB garage
Has to be a penalty
Merc 1-2-3 lmao
Just inagine both mercs blowing up now ... Might be a ferrari podium in the end :D
No...
Norris is getting a podium if Hamilton gets a penalty
Albon on his way to his first podium being driving off the track by Lewis. This is sadly familiar.
Jesus christ
A podium of Merc RP and McLaren is gonna be insane!
perez 4 the win now
"Merc 1,2,3 boys 😔😔"
always leava da space!
I picked the race up on lap 16. Worth going back and re watching?
"5 2 means 5 second penalty possible for 2nd place, push for buffer"
Give me Hamilton penalty pls
[George!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aicQ9nZxiI)
"I really wish for McLaren, but even seeing RP on the podium would be awesome."
I'm curious why they're going full SC so much. Last year it seemed like VSC was going to become the default.
"Norris podium, cmon !!!!!"
Come on Perez
I knew it. It was gonna happen again.
Could be a penalty
At the end of this race Ferrari will be in front of redbull lel
5 second penalty for Hamilton I think. Would be understandable as a race incident.
OK we need Lando to the podium then!
Is Brundle really fucking suggesting not racing? GTFO
Red Bull and Haas could be the biggest losers here this year
Albon is probably too nice but internally he's just about close to saying Fuck Lewis
2019 Brazil again
Lewis you SOB 😭
"Execute order 66, urgent"
Not like thiiiis
Well how much damage did that do to lewis
NOT AGAIN
Fucking crofty jinxed it LOL. He has been talking abt Brazil 2019 incident so often this race.
*Not today*
what’s with all the noted incidents?? shouldn’t it be reviewed there and then so we don’t get a brazil 2019 like event where we don’t see the rightful podiums sitters?!?
"props for Albon, nice try"
So next weekend is going to be super interesting
Sainz is flying!
Albon you were supposed to be the chosen one!
MercedesWinLOL. What a joke of a sport. And even though Perez is on softer tires he has no chance of winning at all.
Albon's luck is just so down.......RB looking terrible at the RB Ring.
5 2 URGENT
"mon Daniil, get into Ocon"
That shot from on the track with the car driving over it with the tire sideways was wild.
I want to die.
Deja by all over again
PODIUM FOR LANDO???
How the hell do you blame Albon for this? Sky clearly showing bias here. He made the pass cleanly and then just was driven through by Lewis.
This race is so painful to watch...
"Sainz fastest lap, what?"
"RBR protest coming in 3,2...."
GIVE HIM ANOTHER 5 SEC PENALTY FOR FUCKS SAKE
Norris Podium possibly
Kill me now
Go Lando!
Real Brazil vibes here I’m loving it
"Ohhh, LH under investigation. Spicy"
"Bono telling Lewis to look after his car, aka don't run it into other drivers."
All this race needs is a Mercedes DNF and Vettel on the podium now.
Well that was an anticlimax. Couldn't the crash at least have trashed the car enough to retire it just to keep in with the tone of the day?
Holy shit
Come on Lando...
Ok so Norris really has to go at Perez
Devastated for albon - nothing malicious from HAM I think but it still fucked Albon badly
Vettel back in the points 🤪
Sainz fastest lap?!?!
Cmon lando
"NOOOOO MY BOY ALBON

on the bright side this opens lando for a podium"
Perez running third after all that... he's always the guy isn't he?!?!
Come on Perez hold on
come on norris!!!!! come on.
What a lap from Sainz
Perez or Norris on podium?
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
Oh look an overtake by Sainz that wasnt shown live.
Ferrari managed an overtake holy shit
wow sainz with fastest lap
"Patience, young grasshopper"
"Albon isn't in that car in 2021, mark my words"
Good recovery by Charles at least lol
Oh ffs Lando
Cmon Lando!
That move
"OOooo. I really don't know if there's blame to be had. Going around the outside comes with expectations of risk, it might be Lewis or a race incident. However... 

LET'S GO LANDON!"
Another yellow and EVERYONE still inside a car will finish in points lol...
Sainz?? Fastest Lap??
Noooooooooo
Whatever happened to that Perez unsafe release?
Get in Leclercccc
Landoo noooo
Norris is a honorable man
What the fuck Sainz?! What the fuck
Lecreccccc
Take him out Sainz or you’re driver 2 next year
Nooo Lando
Why can’t we have nice things
Leclerc podium lmao
"If Albon couldn’t get a podium, I’m glad it looks like Checo will. Hopefully more to come for both of them."
"Who do people find more likeable nowadays, SebVet or Lewis? Just wondering how much has changed in the past couple seasons"
"McLaren with a fastest lap? Love that

Edit: the dream lasted one lap

Edit2: THE DREAM IS ALIVE AND WELL"
Gio got seb?
Ferrari p3
A non Top-3 in the podium??
BONO MY GEARBOX IS DEAD
Does Crofty actually pay attention to drivers names at all
Norris podium?
Crofty strikes again
Vamos Checo !
Fuck that
Cmon NorNor
God damnit I had a bet on Albon on the podium hahaha
"Fuck, if leclerc gets 3rd he deserved a fucking award."
wow that was close
Lando not Sainz
Sainz? That's Norris lmfao
Oh my god Ferrari might get a podium
Lando shows how Hamilton should have behaved with Albon
"If Leclerc gets a podium, he's the new GOAT"
That's how you let someone pass Lewis!
Did Sainz downgrade for next year?
If ferrarri pull this ....
"PODIUM OF THE DAY

BOT
PER
NOR"
And that's how you do it!
"Woah, where did the Ferrari find this pace from"
Go on Charles
Charles incoming somehow lmao
Lucky Ferarri with a new podium probably lol
"Bono: DRS is now enabl-

Lewis: ***I̸̥̚Ṡ̷̡ ̵̀͜Ḿ̷̺Ȳ̵̤ ̸̠͐C̴͖̔Ạ̴́R̴̜̽ ̴̐͜O̶̓ͅK̶̪̽A̷͉̎Y̶̟͗?̶̜͆?̸͉̒?̴̂ͅ***"
Not a Leclerc fan but you got to give him credit for what he is doing in that shitbox.
That Leclerc twitch had my heart in my mouth
Leclerc dragging that shitbox to the podium
Come on crash damnit
This commentator doesn't know who Sainz and who Norris is.
RIP Lando podium
No way are Ferrari gonna get a podium after all that’s happened lmaooo
Leclerc is driving a good race in what seems like a bad car
Lando please please please
What the fuck Charles? How in the fuck?!
Imagine a Ferrari podium here.
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOO
Giovinazzi overtook vettel for 10th. Did his balls just drop off?
Leclerc like a boss!
Finally Ferarri removed their sandbags
"Fire Crofty wtf
Leclerc with Norris in the same team next year?"
Scenes when ferrari gets a podium
COME ON LECLERC
FERRARI POWER 😂😂 we are back baby
Holy shit Ferrari podium?
Perez isn't going to finish podium is he. :/
Ferrari podium incoming
LETS GO CHARLES
Would not have seen a Lec podium.
This got interrsting quickly!
Being passed must have been disappointing but also a releif for Sainz
lol Ferrari is still going to end up on the podium of course
Lec making it work
"Wow, takes his teammate, then takes his possible podium. Piss off Charles /s"
Wait. How the fuck are Ferrari in Fourth lol
"I guess this is expected, sloppy moves, lots of reliability issues"
I DONT WANT THIS RACE TO END
YEE
They've only noted the incident are you kidding me?!
Ferrari special engine mode enabled.
Leclerc not deserving that podium :(
Sandbags off?  LMAO
Come on Charles
Merc losing power and Ferrari winning this race will be the HEIGHT of memes
ffs Crofty
What a drive from Charles
Leclerc could be on the podium lmfaaao what a twist
Albon 😭
I actually called it lmao. Ferrari podium 😂
Ferrari finally worked out how to drop the sandbags?
sainz vs leclerc in a good ferrari is gonna be SO GOOD in a couple of years holy shit
LMAO if Ferrari manages a podium
Come on Charles
"Mercedes 1-2-3, fun"
Extend the race distance!
Come on CHarles
Ferrari podium inc
I’ve never felt happiness turn into crushing disappointment so fast
leclerc-o-beat activated
"Very hard one to judge really but it did look like Lewis chose a line and stuck to it, yes could've given alex more space but he's a hard racer. Don't know why Albon was forcing the move round the outside when he probably could've had an easy one under DRS later on."
Rip Mclaren podium but holy fuck this is amazing
Why can't sky say its Lewis's fault? No Issues shitting on Seb?!
Had a tenner on Albon at 50/1
"If this race keeps unfolding like that, Leclerc's gonna get a podium in this Ferrari"
What an overtake!
Jesus Christ do I dare say it...Ferrari podium?
Engine mode set to: Fuck it lets cheat!
Lewis needs to get going here
Leclerc channeling his inner Alonso dragging this shitbox
LETS GO CHARLITO.
Ferrari gonna end up with a podium after this shit show
Vettel already enjoying retirement
"When Lewis will be penalized Charles will get P3.

Ferrari Master Plan tm"
It's obvious that Ferrari doesn't have the speed of the other cars. Even the racing point pulls away.
"I love me some Checo, but screw it, let's see what Leclerc can do if he can overtake him."
Man I didn’t expect Vettel vs Latifi until next year at least
If Charles get a podium off of this. Massive respect
Horner about to launch a protest for the LeClerc pass on Norris
Ferrari pulling the classic European away performance here.
"Problem is all the experienced drivers are in shit cars. Vettel, Raikkonen, Ricardo and Magnusen (?)."
Leclerc really proving he's the Ferrari future with this race. Good god
The FIA needs to remove the golden horseshoe from Mercedes ass already.
When did they get the backwards camera for the halo hud?
where has this pace been all track?
Ferrari really gonna end up on the podium after this
Crofty a bit rusty on the mclarens today...
fuckin crofty. confused sainz and norris not once but twice
How the fuck is Giovonazzi ahead of Vettel?
Vett and Gio fighting now.
LEC vs NOR shows how its done. HAM should get a penalty for messing it up against ALB.
LETS GOOOOO
5 sec penalty for ham!
Leclerc!
ah fuck this is just gonna be another merc-merc-ferrari finish huh?
Did gio just overtake vettel? Lolll
Vettel just passed 2 cars then dropped down 2... but who’d want to see that
Everyone saying Ferrari are bad and now leclerc can end up coming 2nd
Lewis could get 5s penalty. Perez and Leclere will be on podium
HAHAHWHHWHAHAHAHHAHSHSSHS
[deleted]
Awesome pass
Wowza he’s so good
WTF ferrari fastest lap???
Fucking hell Leclerc is doing it!
"At this point, I don’t care who finishes. Brave from Charlie there"
Fuck yeah Leclerc!
5 SECONDS
WOW
ferrari fastest lap time!! LETS GO
Holy shit Leclerc where did that come from
"All you clowns here mocking ferrari. If they hadn't such a mediocre driver in Vettel, it would be a good result considering everything"
Time penalty for hamilton!
If only Max was this in this race
"
what happend with VET?  He was up to 9th then dropped."
How many times is he gonna call Norris Sainz?
What a move!
Ahahahah
wtf is happening lando noooo
WHAT A RACE! WHAT A FUCKING RACE
Ferrari coming for that podium. My my that would be a massive suprise.
LEC P2 LEC P2
RE CARLOOOOOOOO
Leclerc what an animal
OH SHIT LET'S GO
Giovanazzi overtakes Seb 🤓
HAMILTON 5 SEC PENALTY!
Yes Charles!
HOLY SHIT Charles
THAT is why Ferrari made Leclerc their #1
DID ANYBODY EVRR DOUBT FERRARI? WHERE ARE YOU KNOW FUCKERS
Leclerc what a driver.
Pay attention to who's near who crofty and it's pretty obvious who you're on board with
Hamilton’s going to end up with a penalty right? Could make the race for 2nd-3rd interesting
"Well done LEC, but I'm devastated that Lando has been pushed down."
Wait what?
Penalty for Hamilton!
"Some people say Leclerc should get DotD, i say the kerbs should get DotD"
Yes!!!!
Let’s go Charles #2!
And that should hopefully ruin the 1-2 finish and double podium
If only we had 4-5 extra laps
The only good part of Max retiring was getting to see someone new on the podium. Rip to that dream
WHAT WHAT A JOKE
CHARLES WHAT A MOVE
Holy fuck
MIRACULOUS MOVE
holy shit leclerc my g
FUCK YESSSSSSSSSS LECLERC
"5 second penalty, this is going to be a spicy finish"
The Ferrari actually looks okay now wtf
Grazzi Charlieee
Leclerc to 2nd!
Guys someone pinch me
Hamilton is FUCKED
Leclerc silver. 😂
SEND IT
Beautiful move by Leclerc wow
Just like that Ferrari Podium
"Leclerc man, what a king, about to get a podium in that shit box"
"FERRARI PODIUM, BITCHES"
Rip
"Oh shit, penalty for Ham."
What a last 10 laps
Time penalty!
GET IN THERE LEWIS
FUCKERS!!!!!!!!!!
HOLY SHIT LECLERC
+5sec pen for LH
Ohhh mannn that’s rough
Ferrari going to end up with a podium out of pure dumb luck
5 seconds for ruining race ... Yeah seems fair
Yeah right
Ferrari bumbling to a 2nd place finish
That RP scoots
Wooooow
Woke up super late and just got to turn the race on. Hamilton...oh boy.
VET gained and lost 2 positions suddenly?!
Oh fuck I love you Charles
"Yo I love HAM but fuck that shit, he deserves this penalty."
Well deserved
Wtf is happening
WOAH
YES
Oh thank god we might still get a Perezodium with the time penalty
OH SHIT
Fucking nice one Charles
Ferrari may pull a win out of their ass
LECLERC IS SECOND LOL I CANT BELIEVE IT
c'mon Leclerc beep beep
Can't believe it
LETS GOOOOO LECLERC!!!
KARUMAAAA
Leclerc pulling a Perez
"Good penalty, could have been more. Maybe should have"
It took 65 laps to get Ferrari warmed up
Merde !
leclerc for second
Wtf
2nd Lec baby
"What a move by Sharl!

And fair enough on the HAM time pen."
"Which one have a bigger chance, All Mercedes podium or a Ferrari beating a (pink) Mercedes?"
AWWWWW YEAHH BOIIIII
5 seconds Hamilton!
Leclerc!
NORRIS THE ROADBLOCK
THE SCENES. LECLERC PODIUM
Insert Pep vs Liverpool meme for Hamilton vs Albon
5 second penalty? Spicy!
Ferrari playing 5D chess.
"YEEEEEES, GRANDE CHARLES <3"
I mean I did see Leclerc win very similarly in F2...
Let's go Leclerc.
Damn now car issue vs. driving for the gap that’s gonna be intense
Ferrari placed the FAST button
I LOVE AUSTRIA
Lewis eating all the penalties this weekend
GET IN THERE CHARLES
Justice for loulou
Well that’s the second podium Lewis has ruined for Albon in less than a year then.
VAI CHARLES VAI !!!!!
fucking ridiculous
5 seconds? That's it? That should be 10 at least
Leclerc!!
5s penalty can do one. Awful stewards. Truly awful.
CHARLES LEGREggggggggg
Lewis has to turn that engine up
Leclerc doing an Alonso here.
All apart of the great Ferrari masterplan
ahahaha this raceeeeee   YEEES
Charles really rubbing salt into Sebs wounds.
Lewis just decided he wasn't going to let Albon pass
Five second penalty....that should have been a drive through penalty
That was Albons fault!
"Ihate a Mercedes 1-2, but this penalty is ridiculous"
5 sec is a fucking outrage
"God, Ferrari is memeing their way to the podium."
WHAT A RACE!!!!
Leclerc to finish 2nd. Lol.
#LETS FUCKING GO
Lando choke it
HYPE..!!!
Holy shit that's one hell of a drive by Leclerc
LECLERC OUT OF NOWHERE
Ferrari P1 incoming? 4D Chess!
Leclerc is gonna get second place out of this shit. What a fucking race.
when were you when vvettel  die
Amazing that is LeClerc doing this when Vettel is struggling to gain places at the back of the pack.
The best race in years. Honestly. So chaotic
"Ferrari has no rear end at all, moving all over the damn place"
This is getting spicy
What the hell is Lewis doing. There's a difference between defense and forcing an overtaking car off!
This is shaping up alright
Perez needs to pull every ounce of pace to stay within 5s of Hamilton
"LEC will be P2 in the fifth best car on the grid.

Amazing."
This race has had everything
Lando podium dream still on!
That Ferrari luck
Hmm this race seems to be redeeming itself
Fuck yeah for time penalties.
"Carlos is faster,he can get the podium, what is mclaren doing!!"
If Checo and Charles can push a bit they can be both P2 and P3
Just a reminder: We're getting another GP in this track next week!!
hamilton would be 6th right now
Holy crap it won't be a merc 1-2?
Could have been a podium for Norris. I'm so devastated.
Such a weird race...
What a race!
And Ferrari's gonna get a second place after all
What a fucking race
Lec is driving the piss out of that car
A ferrari in the podium??? I must be dreaming /s
Lando still has a chance! Just finish ahead of Perez within 5 secs of Hamilton.
Nah thats a bullshit penalty
RUN SERGIO RUN STAY WITHIN 5 SECONDS OF HAMILTON
"Bot, Alec and Per for podium"
"Leclerc OP, pls nerf"
HOLY SHIT. WE ARE 2nd!!!!
Lmaoo. Leckerc and perez podium? Sainz could get p4 with this penalty
Charles must have borrowed some of that #blessed
Bottas feels Kalm
Shout out to all the people who left mid-race saying this was a boring one.
COME ON NORRIS
BEST WORST FERRARI PODIUM EVER
Ohh this gonna juicy
Charles shows what kind of fighter he is ...
OMG Charles
Is that Lewis down to 6th then with the 5s pen?
Only 5sec for ruining a potential first win? Sure...
Ferrari p2? WHAT.THE.FUCK lol
Hamilton and Bottas going to activate boost to negate that five seconds
"These penalties are a joke. Once again, the guy getting a penalty will finish way ahead of the guy he took out. Something needs to change there. If you take out a driver you should finish behind the driver you took out."
4 LAPS TO GO LECLERC YOU CAN WIN IT TAKE MY ENERGY
McLaren might get a podium.
I jUsT dOnT sEe HoW tHaTs HaMiLtOnS fAuLt
This race is insane
Everybody gangsta till Ferrari stops sandbagging
Ferrari Master Plan (TM)
Fucking stupid penalty
"Albon has to be patient? He was ahead, it was 100% Hamilton's fault, biased commentators."
"5 sec penalty for putting Albon at the back of the grid, fucking joke"
HAMILTON PENALTY WTF
Charles P2 would be hilarious.
"McLaren drivers, I don't care which of you finishes ahead, but one of you better catch that RP."
Oh it stings to be a norris fan
Carlos should be let by to attack perez
MCL PLEASE GET THAT PODIUM
Mcls will crash
Dayum Charles
Wait wait wait
Lando has no pace fuck
Lando podium back on if he can catch Perez
This race is ridiculous! I love it!
This is fucking excellent!
Did Albon just snatch Vettel back there?!?!
What’s going on with norris today bunch of errors
FIA : RED (BULL) LIVES MATTER
Leclerc acually gets P2. Perez maaaybe P3 (but doubt it will be enough)
"Ferrari on the podium.....
Now that a brave new world I was definitely not expecting!"
Albon and Vettel might be battling it out for 11th lmao
5 seconds but in the 5 laps they can just build that gap
Ferrari P2 :s
Shout out Charles...keeping the Ferrari name
what the fuck is 5 seconds
"Hamilton need to put his foot down a bit now.

With 5 second of him is Norris, so could drop down to 5th."
IM SCREAMING RECORD ME MOM
"Thank you, deer penalty"
TAKE MY ENERGY CHARLES
Well the race at least made it pretty clear who's going to be Ferrari's no 1 driver even tho Albon should have that 3rd place.
Bottas leclerc Perez podium!
Wish this race was 10 laps longer!
THAT IS MAH BOI CHARLES!!
Ah they are finally showing Sainz
Imagine if you said yesterday that Ferrari would be on Podium
wow only 5 seconds
What a yoke 5secs
"Lewis ""I don't feel rusty at all"" Hamilton"
Norris' DRS not activating? Surely he was within range of Perez.
Albon looking for points once again
Carlos-Lado bromance in shamble
Only 5 seconds?
I honestly think Vettel can’t be asked anymore back there
CMON LANDO
Hamilton fastest lap with no curbs lol
Albion should just ram Hamilton next time since that's all he gets out of it. Just forget braking and take him out 100%
"On first view it looking racing incident but, even as a Hamilton fan, I have to admit it was his error."
And people were still comparing Charles with Vettel. Lol.
Is there any benefit to Mercedes to switch Ham with Bottas but keep BOT within a few seconds? Would seem to guarantee BOT still winning and help Lewis come 2nd or 3rd
"Fuck it, Forza Leclerc!"
"Fuck if that Ferrari is 0.5 sec, they win this easy"
Charles divebombing like it's a videogames
Lewis just ramped that engine up
HOW is Vettel doing SO poorly right now? What is going on?
Leclerc be like LOOK AT THE CLEANSE LOOK AT THE MOVES!
We have a chance at a McLaren podium. Let’s gooooo
"I respect Hamilton, but that's 2 podiums stolen right out of the hands of Albon..."
"At least the race directors aren't just showing the cars in places 1,2 so far"
Hammertime lewis
P2 in Constructors for McLaren if they stay where they are.
Is that the standard penalty given for an incident like that?
So Merc is basically like fuck it turn the engines back up.
What's happening with Vettel?
Nice of McLaren to let them race but that's helping Perez a lot
Toto should be wearing a mask beneath the shield
Leclerc 2020=Alonso 2012
Hamilton gonna set three consecutive fastest laps to retain second here.
Rip u/Alphamaxnova01
Evil Lewis
A Ferrari-McLaren-McLaren podium would be sweet from this point.
So much drama I love this so much
Hamilton has to hope another safety car doesn’t come out
Come on papaya bois get that podium
Ffs McLaren needs to stay close
"Good lord, people calling for a stop-go after the +5s? What are people watching?"
Norris podium?
gotta love how it's beneficial to run competitors of the track
Loooolllll what
is Ferrari going to pull a Mercedes and win at the very end?!
Fair play to Bottas he’s dealt with Hamilton well this race
5 seconds? Didn't Kimi get like 10 second penalty for the same incident in Silverstone in 2018?
LANDO PODIUM
LANDO
"WHAT, CHECO PENO"
Wouldn’t be surprised if that Merc could open up a 5s gap..
WHAT?
Just feeling lucky that the Mclarens are so close together for Perez
here is hoping ham gear box going poof
LANDO PODIUM???
Penalties galore
LANDO PODIUM?!?!
WTF IS ALL THIS RACE
Lando podium? Bois?
Only 5 sec for ham is a joke.
"albon must be furious all the way back there, he was in for something"
WHAT IS THIS RACE HAHAHA
wtf happening lol
PEREZ LMAO SPEEDING
LANDO PODIUM
5 sec for Checo!
Another penalty :0
HAM on the podium!!
FIA on a mod ting
"You get a penalty, you get a penalty, everyone gets a penalty!"
Ferrari's master plan of being reliable while the others all have mechanical issues paying off clearly
WAIT PENALTY FOR PEREZ LANDO PODIUM
What is going on?
Hamilton did to Albon what Albon did to him in the first lap.
W H A T
Lando to the podium boys!
"Checo always manages a surprise podium, he can do it again!"
Penalties everywhere
"Bottas should try to slow down Hamilton so he drops more spots. Seeing as Hamilton is his only challenger for the title, it could be a smart move. And we all know Mercedes will win the constructors title anyway."
LMAFAO now Norris is technically on podium
LOL
Haahahahahahahahah
OH MY LORD A LANDO PODIUM!?!
norris needs to gain some time to hit podium right?
He did a Maldonado
I just dont think that was lewis fault?
Holy fuck what is this race
Hamilton didn't open his steering lock at all...
LANDO P3
Penalties just getting handed out like candy now.
Cmon norris there's a podium to be had
"Fastest lap with gearbox issues and avoiding curbs, god I fucking hate mercedes in a they're too fucking good way"
So..... Norris podium :)
Norris podium!!!
Oh no Perez
Lewis will gain 5 seconds on leclerc in 3 laps
Come on Norris. Get a podium
Lando podium hype!
LANDO PODIUM INCOMING
Perez 5 sec. LANDO GOOOO

LANDO 3RD

LMFAO
Norris on podium!
PEREZ HAS A PENALTY LANDO IS ON THE PODIUM
LANDO PODIUM INCOMING
RIP albon :(
So the first race of the year is just a cluster...
Wow the retirements.....
Perez NOOOO
Penalty central!
Can I commission a painting of Lando passing Carlos for the podium!?!?
"Perez penalty, what in God's name is this race?"
Cmon Norris find half a second!!
"Norris in p4 so far! Come on, Mercedes, explode"
Would be a different story if Hamilton pushed Albon off. Ridiculous.
No clue what is going on in this race anymore...
Leclerc on 3rd. Fuck me.
What’s difference between Lewis and Seb touching and Lewis and Albion touching
Fuuuuuuuck. Norris podium confirmed.
This is a proper shit show
Who would have thought a Ferrari would be on the podium after free practice and qualifying?!
in before they let Hamilton overtake Bottas on the grounds that he stay less that 5 seconds ahead
What is this race. Crazy awesome
Inter McLaren scrap is awesome
Well after today anyone claiming the FIA is biased towards Hamilton should be ridiculed.
Ferrari sacrificed 3 years of good tactics for this.
This race is insane
wonder if Toto has tear-offs on that visor
HUH? Mclaren podium?
Get lando on the podium
hahah this is mental
"After all this, Leclerc to finish 2nd in an absolute shitbox and both Red Bulls are practically out. Wow."
I LOVE THIS RACE
Norris p3
WHAT
"Lando, 3rd?"
"Poor Albon, properly feel for him, twice this has happened now"
Norris lets go!
Wtf is this race lmao
5 seconds for speeding? Used to be a slam dunk drive through.
WHAT IS THIS RACE
whaaat lando podium!
Huge Seb fan but Charles drove a much better race than him today. Even though it took some luck getting that shitbox onto the podium is incredible.
Lmao @ red bull
cmom perez stay in the gap
This is insane.
Perez with a penalty too. Fuck what's happening.
This race lmao
ARE YOU KIDDING ME
Wtf going on lol
Norris needs to get within 5 seconds of Hamilton
Safety car???
8 cars out lmao
I'm surprised that Norris can't catch Perez
NORRIS PODIUM HYPE
DON'T JINX IT GUYS
this is fucking wild
Lando pls podium
This race is insane
"Albon, get the safety car out"
Fucking hell this is genuinely an amazing race.
Alex no
Noooo Perez :( dammit
1.Bottas 2.Leclarc and 3.Ham 2019 continues
Red Bull have had a mare
Damn this race keeps on giving
Lando might be on the podium!! Holy shit!
Perez penalty is gonna help Ham

Ohh spicy norris go hell bent for leather now.
Man. RBR is having the worst day they could possibly have.
What the actuel fuck is going on.
A 5 second penalty is nothing compared to the victim. Alex should get 10 seconds added to him final time while Lewis should be getting whatever time t cost Alex.
WTF ? WHY ?
Fia is in Hamilton's pocket
"oh come on, what is happening right now"
ESKETIT
Gonna take a lot of math to sort out this podium...
ALBON NOOOOOOOO
Latifi just 2 DNFs from a point
Bruhhhh Red Bull’s are dead
Bottas also a time penalty to give Leclerc the win? Lol
Stupid dive from Norris.
And more reliability issues...
SPEEDING IN THE PITLANE 💀😭

F1s new battle royale game mode is looking pretty good

Elimination race
My stream just cut out for a minute and it seems like so much shit happened
Anyone have Russels number so I can check on him after this
"BOTTAS

DONT LET HAMILTON IN

HES YOUR MAIN FUCKING RIVAL"
What's happening!? What a chaotic race.
What’s the record for most retirements in a race?
"Very new to F1, surely there aren't this many retirements normally?"
What the fuck is this race?
"Typical Perez, trying to cut someone off"
It's the second avoidable colision with Hamilton and Albon. Just 5 sec on that ine is a joke
This race absolutely feels like how i feel about 2020 so far
Pretty wild ride for a first race
The tire just flew off. Simone check on Perelli
The kerbs are fucking people. What is going on.
VET has blood in his eyes
Speeding in the pit lane? Was that during SC?
What a great first race lol. Lets just scrap Australia from the calender.
Are they gonna let Hamilton pass Bottas to open the gap
Holy shit. What is this race?
1 more and Williams in the points
We could have Lando on the podium here...

WTF they are all dying all over the place
ALL TOP 10 NEED PENALTIES
Hamilton too far ahead. We're not going to get the podium :(
Norris take my energy
There's still enough time left for less than 10 cars to finish. It's a war of attrition out there.
And there wasn't a drop of rain. Wtf was this race. This is amazing
 Ferrari for WDC. They only need half the grid to faint on any given race.
Only one honda powered car is finishing and it's NOT because of engine issues
Ooof what a shitshow
All the cars are rusty
"Ham's car was ""damaged"" while he was under investigation. But now it's setting the fastest laps, how handy."
Man there are some fragile shitboxes out there today.
Wow Latifi came so close to points
"* Latifi drives slow
* Might get points???"

"9 cars, wow"
Which of you fools had the Monkeys Paw?
Suspension failure for Kyvat?

Imagine being the guy that doesn’t get any points
This race has been amazing. Loved this return...
"9 retirements, holy cow"
Time trial for Lando and Lewis!

If this is what f1 is like all the time I’m in
"I rooted for Seb for years and years. The way Ferrari handled the contract situation was absurd, but this race, the passing, the race pace... Yeah, Seb's time in Ferrari has passed. He's better than what he's showing and he needs a change."
"Absolute carnage, wow"
Can Williams finish in the points?!

Lmao not surprised Lando would hit that #3 marker.
haha goooooo LANDO
oh yeah :D ferrari reliable shitbox
Lando baby
Finally a good fucking race
"I want to cry, probably one of the best f1 races ever"
WTF
Can't believe Ferrari got a P2 out of that
"What an opener, can we make this the new opening race ever season?"
BRING ON THE NEXT ONE!
Yaaaaasss Norris. Well done lad.
UNLUCKY ALEX LAD!
That was incredible holy shit
YES LANDO GOOD SHIT SON!
LANDOOOOOOOO
F1 IS BACK BABY
What a fucking race! Wow
YES YES YES YEEESSSSSSSSS
HOLY HEELLL
"Christ, my heart... Gonna pop a couple of valium and lie down in a dark room."
Kvyat :(
What. The. Fuck.
Super drive from Bottas honestly.
"Not gonna lie, kinda lame first 61 laps. Last 10 laps were crazy."
Absolute wild start!
LANDOOOOO
Well that penalty on Perez make things a little bit interesting
I can't feel my heart
Great result Lando! That was amazing!
OmG
"This was a very heartbreaking race as a Max and RBR fan. But it's a bit saved with Bottas winning, Lewis not getting top points (makes competition possible) and Lando's podium!"
"What a race. I'm so happy for Lando! I cheered at the TV when I saw he was 4.8 to Hamilton.

(Big Hamilton fan by the way, but he should have left more racing room)."
So happy to have McLaren back
Who else had to watch the replay of the race because f1tv wasn't working
"Me: Holy shit what a boring race, Mercedes 1-2 easy 1-2 Verstappen out, here's a joke, year 2020 bad

Reddit: 25 upvotes for your, sir.

Glad that aged like milk."
"Tbf Hamilton shouldnt have gotten a punishment for that contact with Albon.

But I'm happy with this podium."
Only 5s?? What a fucking joke
Who took the knee?
"Horner and Marko in absolute shambles

Meetings are taking place now on what reason to protest Mercedes for this"
Hamilton is different gravy man. Only Verstappen and Russel are close to him.
That was Albon's fault this time. EDIT: I think.
Literally doesn’t matter if Ham gets a penalty as they are so quick
Mercedes have ruined formula 1
I see that Zak Brown is practicing social distancing
Lol. 14/71 laps and people are complaining about the season already
Is Haas the most unlikeable team? Or does anyone think there is one more unlikeable?
"Is there anyone that really thinks Vettel is still good enough to win another Championship, even if he was given a good car. He just makes too many mistakes"
Those people are just there to watch the race on their phones. While risking their health.
Verstappen could have won this race
"If Mercedes somehow win this, they are just so lucky. We need a new winner just for the sake of the sport."
Lewis can't handle pressure all I have to say
Please FIA be fair. Punish Lewis
GET FUCKED HAMILTON HAHAHAHAHAHAH
Anti stall! Its bwoken!
You love to see it
Is Red Bull going to protest their engine performance?
"Na na na na, na na na na, hey hey, goodbye..."
"Bottas is so fuk

If he had Max between him and Lewis he had a good chance. Now he is so fuck"
Not F1 without Grosjean messing up
"""It looked more like a brakes issue rather than brain fade""

Brundle what the fuck is brain fade"
That safety car appearance was not rigged at all
Fascinating how it all plays in lewis favor once again
"Imagine how many races were ruined by strategy at Ferrari, now imagine that with an awful car. As a supporter of a rival this is almost gonna be as satisfying as when Fergie left United"
This track is basically one big DRS zone... Ruins all the racing.
I think I'd like Perez and Stroll more if it wasn't for their hideous car. It looks like a German chocolate bar.
[deleted]
Classless Hamilton
Hamilton is dirty as hell.
"I'm so tired of this bullshit... When is Ross Brawn going to get these drivers shoving each other off the track under control?

(and I say this as someone that was rooting for Hamilton)"
Hamilton couldn't have done anything there
That is a slap on the wrist for Lewis.
5 seconds. What do the Lewis apologists have to say now?
Joke penalty on HAM. He can't turn any tighter
Get fucked Lewis
[deleted]
Any talk about Vettel winning anything this year should just stop. I doubt he will be picked up by any team any time soon.
I am happy for Bottas but it looked like Lewis could have easily overtaken him if it wasn’t for the orders to stay inside while Bottas didn’t really follow them
"Racing incident, anyone who thinks otherwise is just fanboying at this point.

Albon over committed."
Would Lewis' braids not be uncomfortable in the helmet?
"Verstappen, looked like Raikkonen and at least 4 others didnt take a knee for those wondering"
Vet out turn 1
the day drs goes is a good day
I can't wait for this to not be HAM's 85th win
Stroll is ass my dudes
"Please park it somewhere safe. Accept it.

Car is dead. We don't need a safety car."
"Should have taken the knee....

/s"
LOL REDBULL IS WORSE THAN FERRARI
Hahahahahahhahahahahaha
Honda > Ferrari they said lol
Lewis got really lucky.
"""Celebrating Dutch passion from home""
Damn what a shot"
"Well, the race ended too soon"
Max starts playing video games then has a software issue on the first race back.  Sucks but that's kind of amusing.
Ferrari hacking other cars (like Verstappen) is the only way they will finish on Podium
That ferrsri is impotent can’t even close in on the force India with drs
Bye bye wdc max.
This is what we get for filing all those protests ugh
Everyone loves to laugh at Ferrari but RBR really isn't much better
Literally all the wrong people are having engine problems :(
17 laps in and the race is virtually decided.
the fuck k mag
McLaren really need to sort out their pitstops. They keep messing them up.
Fingers crossed for a merc engine failure
Latifi is bad so far 😬😬😬😬
"Bono, I have no engine"
Latifi has no excuse
Does the smoke that keeps puffing out of the Racing Point have anything to do with the Ferrari engine issue that was contested last year?
Texas Longhorns::college football as Ferrari::F1
Another spin from Seb
"McLaren pace is a little disappointing, expected them to be closer to RB. Sainz should've overtaken Leclerc by now."
Urgent chassis default to slower pace so Hamilton can go through
Russel > Vettel ?
amazing to me how early through the corners Lewis starts putting his foot down. Bottas is going to get taken ad there's nothing he can do. Merc is dominant an all that but Lewis is a superb driver!
F2 is just better at this point
Stop talking over the radio or cars Crofty. You utter gobshite.
inb4 both mercs take each other out on the restart
Let’s go Albon!
This is one of the most exciting races I have seen in a while!!!!
Albon is too inexperienced
Racing incident. Nothing to control there.
"Classic Hamilton, try to pass he crashes you"
Hamilton better be FUCKING PENALIZED. FUCKING Garbage.
"Well, looks like Hamilton's gonna lose positions after the race again"
Brundle will defend Hamilton to hell and back
So silly by Albon. Lewis was in a similar spot against Albon at the race start and pulled out of it.
Lmfao fuck this shit race
Interesting move by Hamilton into Abon after Merc said to clear of the kerbs.... no need to go that wide it looked like. Idk.
Please not Leclerc podium
Come on checo! U deserve this podium
That is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. Not a penalty at all.
Suck it HAM
"Bottas winning and Hamilton finishing 7th? 

THE FUCKING DREAM START"
Red Bull deserves all the shit they're getting today lmao
"I understand the penalty, but I still felt like the incident wasn't intentional. That's just a risk whenever you try to pass in a turn.

I could see the ruling either way so it doesn't blow my mind."
"Fuuuuuck fuck Lewis. I respect him and all, but damn, Albon got fucking robbed"
That 5 seconds was fucking bullshit. Just bully Hamilton weekend this has been. Fucking shit.
This is going to the Stewards Room
"Looking at the steering angle of Hamilton, he couldn’t have done anything to avoid Albon."
No post race thread? Mods up to their usual high standards I see
"This 5 second penalty is bunk...big deal, that's why Hamilton keeps doing it, doesn't really affect him in his mercedes, but whoah does it screw Albon over with no remorse...so much for blm...he's done this twice to a fellow minority driver, ridiculous!"
"OK, fuck this shit. I'm turning it off. There is only Mercedes & the rest at this point. This is the least competitive era of F1 ever."
[removed]
Vettel has to be the most overrated driver on the grid.
I've always kind of admired Hamilton but after today? Friendship ended. Fuck that guy
Now you see why some of us hate lewis
Make no mistake if the Mercedes could use the whole track Lewis would have passed Bottas. He was clearly faster.
"Maybe Mercedes should lodge a complaint after the race against Redbull. Going too slow on the track. Safety, innit."
"Lol decades, surely he means less than 7 decades"
"question, do they need to do the whole anthem thing next week? or just straight to the race."
We made it guys
Anyone heard why Toto gets a pass wearing the clear mask instead of a traditional mask? Doesn't seem as safe for himself or others
Here is for a nice clean race. Hopefully the first few laps are clean and tidy
Ah the infamous Sharls is back. God I miss this
Is it already race over with Max out of DRS range for Bottas? woooow Merc is too good
"Ferrari a joke

&#x200B;

Topkek"
Bottas race winner already
"Max setting the fastest lap on mediums, oh shit."
"Albon or Norris are going to have their 1st podium. Either way, I'm happy."
LETS GOOOOOOOO
yes! go albon
That red bull is so red I thought it was a Ferrari
Hamilton flying
How are these Ferraris so slow? This is baffling
"Karma for red bull

Build a better car next time"
KARMA #33
Lol red bull trying to kick mercedes. Kicked themselves
Karma is a bitch
Fantastic!
"Newbie here-

What tracks are generally referenced as the best and worst tracks on the schedule? How does Austria stack up?"
Championship gone for Max?
"fuck me, why is it always mercedes 1,2"
At least Ferraris engines still run
Merc 1-2
Will we see a Renault overtake a Ferrari today!?!
Why did i buy an f1tv subscription this year? This is going to be a long dull season
Wtf Honda?? Ugh Merc 1-2....
This was his year...
"This means Albon, Norris or Perez in 3rd!"
What a disappointment
"Wonder what's happening to Stroll today.  He seems much slower than he was showing in practice/qualifying, which is pretty opposite than usual for him."
Empire strikes back
"Get in there, Lewis"
7.5 second lead. That's 3000whp horsepower in a 1/4 mile
"Vettel mistake, DRINK!"
Kinda new to F1. Did Max do something wrong? Or was that just bad luck?
Stroll :(
Absolute scenes when Ferrari manages to have the most reliable engine
That tracing point engine looks tired 😅
"Let's go, Kimi!"
Can the whole field just be eliminated and we start over tomorrow
"Can't wait for the season to start, watching reruns of Mercedes 1-2s is getting dull"
Wth is going on???
Everyone dropping like flies to make way for a Ferrari podium
Stroll with no power and it still takes Ferrari 4 laps to overtake. Grazzie ragazzi grande laboro di merda
Renault you are garbage
This is really like the 2014 season.
"If Seb keeps going over those yellow sausage curbs, he's going to join Venstappen in the shower room before long..."
"Just tuned in, what happened with Max?"
HAHAHAAHA
Has Australia been cursed since Alan Jones
"*Red Bull Snitching*

All that for that..."
Honda wtf bro? Maybe it was cranked up to high... fucking ay
lmao romain is back
[Max and Daniel off like it's 2017](https://giphy.com/gifs/dance-rap-rave-BgWGTu2TgdP44)
SO MANY DNF’s
"Hamilton is hungry and will win in the end lol, Bottas just isnt fast enough"
"Lawrence: Spends millions so son can have an F1 drive and get good results
Racing Point: Hold my tracing paper"
How is grosjean still an F1 driver
21 laps into the first race and 3/4 engines have had problems causing a retirement... wow that could be interesting this season
Come on Esteban
"LOL you're not fooling anybody, Ferrari!"
How can you work with Romain. Don't people get violent urges around this frigging dude. Year after year same shit.
So the whole season is going to be about BOT versus HAM. None of the other cars or drivers come even close. Boring.
How is Hamilton this quick ffs why can’t we just see a damn title fight between him and Bottas at least
Time for me to go back to sleep I guess
"Ricciardo: ""thank god, next year Im driving with a Merc power"".

Realizes Stroll retired with an engine issue: ""oh shit!""."
fuckin Haas
Imagine Guenther Steiners blood pressure
Lol this episode of Drive to Survive is gonna be spicy at HAAS.
I was wondering who would get an unsafe release in this madness
Hamilton is about to eat bottas for lunch at the restart
Are kerb vibrations a valid explanation over this sort of failures or are the casters making stuff up?
[deleted]
The first race of the season and disappointing already....2020 is cursed indeed
Why is safety car still out?
"Some people in England already got an response from Horner?

He talks alot with Sky right? During the race?"
"Pardon my ignorance, but I thought DAS was banned this season?"
Can we go 30 minutes without talking about how DAS works
Perez podium if tyres stay till the end?
Sainz taking out Vettell. How methaphoric.
"As much as we like to meme this

Sainz kinda closed on Vettel

He had nowhere to go"
Maybe its really time for vettel to stop racing
Vettel: 'WheRe'S mY CoNtRaCt?'
Spin. Guess who?
"Crazy how in 1 lap merc is 2,5s clear of the next lol"
"tell you what. it'll be strange not to see a Williams in plumb last for once.

Gogo George!"
Seb backwards on the track in a shitbox and still ahead of Williams
Russell slow and steady sneaking up to catch a point
Seb's racecraft as a multiple champion is horrendous
[deleted]
Williams 8th and 9th such a dream
How long until Latifi is out of F1? over under 1 season?
vettel is just a slightly faster grosjean
NO JAMES NO JAMES
"Is Ham really on the radio saying he wants a pass, or is that Sky making shit up?"
Hammertime
Yeah that Ferrari sounds like shit
Glorious George is nearly twenty seconds ahead of Little Latifi
Just need Perez to overtake Albon.
Still waiting for that Perez penalty..
On board sounds are horrible today
Ocon finally getting more screentime than last year
Did the pit lane thing with Checo result in anything yet?
6 seconds behind Merc. Unbelievable domination
Show us the fucking front
‘And the two Mercs come together!!!!’ That’s want we want to hear pls
Albon is gonna win!!!!!!!!!!
F1 bottle feeding Lewis wins now /s
Sensor issues for Merc throwing them out of the race honestly wouldn't be horrible. At least Max would have more of a shot at the WDC
"Hey, where's everyone else? Is this the Merc racing series?"
"So, what's everyone drinking right now?"
"Yea, I don't think both Mercs are going to finish the race."
What I would give for both Mercs to go out ...for the lulz.
imagine being vettel rn
We need fueling back
Why not only race with the Mercedes cars? Only cars that are broadcasted.
I honestly Didn’t think my quarantine could get more boring. Time to turn off and Watch Fauda on Netflix.
Thank you for giving us different cars finally...
"Bottas is going to wreck his car by going over kerbs, lose power, go off or otherwise lose time. Hamilton to pass and get 1st, everyone here gonna say he's ""lucky"". You heard it here first."
Never change Grosjean
Someone explain to me how Grosean is still in F1
Grosjean being grosjean again
Please give me an Albon win somehow
LETS GO ALBON
ALBON PLZ
Albon take our energy!
Kimi OUT
I put $10 each on Perez and Norris for podium finishes. Cmon Mercedes break those gear boxes
What a pass
Kimi noo
Damn Kimi :(
That's an untethered tire
Since when can you overtake sc before it's in?
Albon almost had Perez
There was yellows before albon overtook him lmao
Im starting to think half of the cars have covid
"So everyone behind the Mercs is on faster tyres...

So you're saying there's a chance!?!?"
Everyone is gonna get points this race...
How many people need to finish for points to be handed out?
Wait shouldn’t Perez give that place back? He passed after safety car
"Split screen, very American."
"The car is gone, let's go!"
Would be quite interesting if RBR just decided that they ought to get that place without consulting the stewards or race control.
10 laps enough for Alex to take the race to the Mercedes?
"Albon to just kamikaze the mercs.. 

Safely of course"
"Albon raising his salary a bit this race

Edit: whoops, nevermind."
COME ON ALEX
Cmon Alex!!
Vote grosjean for driver of the day
Thats gonna be a penalty for Lewis
WHAT THE FUCK. GIVE HIM A PENALTY
Ohhhh he should’ve waited
Lel again
"At the MOMENT I said take it easy Albon, he ticked himself off"
Hahahahaha devaju
HAHAHAHAHAHA.
Red bull to protest again
wow hamilton .. wow
"Damn alex, shud be more patient."
100 percent albons fault. No patience
Albon wtf... Have some patience
Stupid stupid place to try and overtake around the outside
Albon use your head. Fresher tires and you do that.
Alex's fault
"HAMILTON NOOOOO but maybe it was Alex's fault I need to see it again. 

Edit: now I've seen it again, 100% Hamilton's fault again. I can't stand Hamilton and this is just so annoying."
Lewis penalised again ala Brazil?
Facking hell Albon. Why?
God damn it albon. Have some fucking patience instead of trying it in a impossible corner
"Nooo albonnnn, Hanilton did itt againnnn"
Perez on the podium LETS GO
Mercedes killing racing again fuck me
Nooooooo
DAMN YOU LEWIS
like these commentators are fucking stupid
Hamilton definitely should have left him space after those replays
Penalty for Hamilton?
HE WAS AHEAD UGHHHHH
ALBON WAS AHEAD
Albon was half car ahead
Was that Hamilton's fault? It kinda looks like it.
After Albon ran Hamilton wide round the outside on lap one Albon was very brave to try and do the same thing back.
Of course the Sky Team are quick to not blame their boy Lewis
"Albon was ahead, Lewis had the inside line"
I don't think Lewis is welcome in the redbull garage
Watch Hamilton get a 5 sec penalty demoting him precisely no places
"Lol, for all the mask and Gloves safety, RB mechanics touching their faces and eyes"
Lewis should get penalised here.
Alex throwing hands with Ham after this I bet
There was no need to take the risk for Albon. Hamilton had issues and he should know that. Too eager :(
All my homies hate Hamilton
iS aLbON oKaY?
"Not defending Hamilton, but if Albon slowed down for a moment, at least he has another chance to attack Hamilton."
Leclerc to get P3??
Leclerc with an advantage now..lol..this race is mind fucking..
Leclerc earning that Ferrari pay cheque.
Leclerc might make the podium
Get in there Charlie...
The Ferrari engine sounds so quiet
6 months break has been tough on Crofty recognizing cars.
Giovinazzi overtook Vettel. 😯
Noice Leclerc
what..? that wasnt lewis fault. he gave albon enough space.
Deserved penalty
F1 trying to nerf mercedes
Lewis penalty...you love to see it
"bs penalty, wasn't Ham's fault"
Wont argue it but that seems excessive. Seemed like a racing incident to me.
"Ham penalty come on Leclerc! 

Who would have thought Ferrari could get 2nd, what is happening"
"I was marginal on if that'd be 5sec or racing incident.

Can't really come down hard."
Ferrari: the little engine that could!
Lewis with all of the penalties today 💀
LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOO!! 5 SECONDS!
Should be a drive through imo
"Albon should have waited, the mercs are on the back foot, with drs he would have had them"
Hamilton is starting to be a bit of a dirty driver in his older age .. he has too much baggage for me to support any longer.
5 second penalty doesn't seem enough for destroying Albon's race AGAIN
Does this mean Lando is on?
5 seconds issa yoke
If Bottas win the WDC then that’s the proof that Merc can make anyone a champion
HONDA POWER
Red Bull fucking F.
PLEASE SAFTEY CAR
I can't work out what Lewis was meant to do to avoid that collision
THIS RACE HAS BEEN PHENOMENAL
Lol at red bull
Come on safety car.....
"TAKE THAT HAMILTON

KARMA IS SWEET"
[deleted]
LANDO FASTEST LAP LANDO PODIUM LANDO LEGEND
First F1 race I've ever sat down and watched. I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED.
Fucking get in there Charles.
"I hope next race is a bit less of a battle of attrition and more Motorsport, but I'll take what I can get"
Latifi didn't get a point haha
Driver of the Day: Albon?
Is Lewis going to lose any points against his license for that move?
Wish if every race will be thai interesting! This race deserved live crowd
[deleted]
When was the last McLaren was on the podium?
[removed]
"Fucking awful call, Albon ran out of room to the outside"
Wonder if Red Bull will protest this
"The engines sound absolutely horrible on the on-board cams, ugh. Like a broken vacuum cleaner. I miss how they sounded back in 2000 or so."
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Ridiculous penalty.
Red bull need a change. How many times has this happened over different years? Inexcusable with their budget and resources
[deleted]
Everyone defending drivers for standing while others were kneeling because they wanted to avoid controversy. The rest of the world will see the decision to stand as much much more controversial. If showing support for BLM is to controversial for half the sport then the racial problems within F1 are deeper then I thought.
Protest that lolololol
Should’ve taken the knee..
"Lewis is completely in the wrong on that one, that was a great move by Alex ruined by unsportsmanlike driving."
Lol. All the drama over the penalty and it's 1-2. Come on Lewis.
"Lewis baby please, we saw at the end of last stint you can eat Valtteri alive, slow down for now and keep that engine cool 🥺"
Bottas should move over for HAM
"Well Horner, today you've learnt a very valuable lesson:

Stir shit, eat shit"
Lewis is the moan zone lol ! doesn't take long .
"5sec penalty is bullshit, too lenient"
haha. That’s made my day.
"OMG THIS IS THE BEST RACE EVER!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Kimi just lost a whole tire!! It just came off!! On Kimi's car!!! 
7th retirement!! Not to mention both the Mercs basically CAN'T RACE as they can anymore. 
This is the best. The whole curb discussion by the Sky commentating team, with the Merc team interjecting about what defines a curb 😂😂😂"
[deleted]
It's really Karma for RBR for all the protests
Good call FIA... Merc DAS isnt unfair at all...
Mercedes should be banned
Bottas will never be on Lewis his level. If this was the other way around Lewis would be leading with 3 seconds already.
"UNLUCKY...

Karma for you."
"~~2 Renault engines out.~~

RBR's switch slipped my mind. Sorry!"
[deleted]
YES!
Protest that Red Bull
Remember when Vettel was good? Me neither 😂😂
[deleted]
"Imagine complaining about Merc, just to lose power in your #1’s car, and have Hamilton finish ahead anyways. 2020 is wild."
This race is poor. I want lockdown back.
"Damn, F1 races are still the best way to take a nap.

e: haha looks like you guys don't like people napping to soothing engine sounds and commentator voices."
Can someone tell me the thing around 'taking the knee'. I'm OOTL. Thanks!
Honda just gave us another Merc 1 2. Sigh
I don’t know why the first retirement of the season being Max with the Honda engine just doesn’t surprise me at all
"Ferrari is shit. Redbull is poo, Mercedes is 1-2"
"""Bottas, move aside please"""
"Two leading cars within 1 second. 

Race director: let’s ignore them!"
This race has been insanely boring. Thanks Merc for making some nonsense drama I guess. Can't wait to be bored again next week lmao
Driver the day Sergio so far?
"I'm confused. I was told every race would be a Merc 1/2 - guaranteed? Hmmm

Almost like we should wait until the races"
"I hate Lewis, such a wet wipe winging because he’s not first when it’s the team that should matter for him, his had his championships"
That wasn't Lewis fault
"Boring. Merc's already have the race won, I don't know why F1 persist with such a boring track, they should just scrap this race and replace it with the Styrian GP permanently."
Unpopular opinion: I've missed formula 1 but have not missed these 2 jerkoffs from sky commenting it.
"Ferrari 1.2 off the pace

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha"
Hahah redbull is shambolic
this is some instant karma stuff from red bull lol
ugh fuck Mercedes
Think I'll skip the next race 😴
Oh so as soon as someone gets past you u just let them go? No
Stewards are crazy. No way that was a penalty in my opinion
5 seconds is a damn joke
[deleted]
Racing incident for me. Lewis was always going to end up understeer into him
"stop spamming f1tv is not working, it's your fault for making shit decisions."
Shouldn’t have protested Lewis’s grid position sorry
all of that protesting and this LOL
"Rises are red


Mercedes 1-2

All thanks to

The Honda PU"
"Racing incident, no pen."
I don't get how anyone can argue with a straight face that Hamilton is an elite driver. He's a sore loser that has an amazing car. That was clearly intentional and I'm sure he'll get a tap on the wrist for it.
Not Lewis’ fault
"Albon is so silly, you can't divebomb around the outside when someone is into the corner that long before you and isn't expecting a car to be there. Was an easy pass in the next laps if he didn't rush it."
"I'm glad about Lando, but that overtake on Perez was...questionable"
[deleted]
Should have kneeled Max
I hate to be that guy but BOY IS THAT A SHOW OF KARMA!
Hamilton needs a fucking race ban
Eat fucking crow RB
[deleted]
Albon with another rookie mistake. Had 9 laps to get that overtake job done and rushed it against a vet.
you know it's gonna be a good race when the Dr Pepper 'copter does a sweep
Max is coming for that ass Bottas
"Lmao, wait for F1 to restart just to end up with this shit. Fuck it, I'm watching the Real Madrid game"
"""I came here to ~~race~~ retire early"" - Max Verstappen"
Why is it called the Red Bull ring? Could someone explain that to me?
How are Mercedes going strategise this to get LH to win
[deleted]
It took that long for VET to pass ~~PER~~ STROLL with a shit car.. unbelievable
Grosjean bottled it
Haas are fooking spinners
"I have this thinking, Im 90% sure Mercedes will retire before the new car debuts"
Bottas won’t win this race
Wtf sainz
"Doesn't  safety car give an unfair disadvantage to a driver who was leading with high time diffence.


Like botas had a 6 second lead. Now it's just 2"
God i've missed this shit
Bottas is fucked. Congrats Lewis on the win
Hahahaha vettle being vettle
"Come on Vettel, I believe you have it in you to spin at every race this year!"
So apparently a bunch of teams are changing next season and I have been totally out of the loop about it all because the world went crazy.  Is there an overview somewhere of who is going where next season?  Sucks to see Vettel leaving.
And Bottas will probably just move over
Ujjjuu
"If it's as bad as Mercedes is making out to be, they need to give the 1-2 order so that they both stop pushing."
So F1 is doing reverse grid every other race correct? Latifi on pole will be a sight
[deleted]
Looks like that would be pirellis fault?
Alex and Lewis dont go together. That was a poor overtake
F\*\*\* you Hamilton
"Talk shit, get hit."
Too soon to attack
"FUCK HAMILTON

TWICE!! KUAY!!!"
Fuckin Alex...dude patience..
"Hamilton looks full lock during that, harsh to blame him."
"Please god blow up the 2 mercs, divine intervention is needed."
Why does Hamilton hate Albon then?
"Hamilton's fault. Albon didn't have to force it, but that was all Hamilton."
"Looked like Hamilton tried to give him room, but I don't know."
Boneheaded move
if alex waited abit more
Leclerc god
[deleted]
only 5 seconds? Jesus
"Lewis Hamilton is a piece of trash, sore fucking loser."
"lewis was full lock and not accelerating i think, not his fault imo"
Please Charles keep it under 5 seconds
Leclerc is gonna be on podium and Vettel isn't even on the points.
GET ABSOLUTELY FUCKED HAM
Bottas should've slowed to let Hamilton past a few laps ago already.
The nr 3 car is closer to the front than nr 2 car. This bothers me.
That penalty is BS. Albon forced him onto the grass at the start...
I think its time to talk about how Lando can never hold onto a lead
Karma
My sources are telling me that Red Bull will file a protest against the engine failure
"HAHAHAHAHAAH

Been moaning about Ferrari and then poof, it's gone! Sorry but this is gold."
I DREAMED THIS 😳
If merc doesn’t have a gearbox failure I’m not watching F1 again . I’m praying
Now RBR dont have Renault to blame. Weirdos! Hahahahahaha.
"Well that was a bit awkward. 

""Can the fashwave kids stand at the back, please"""
[deleted]
Red Bull too focused on appealing that they didn't look at the car.
"Merc 1-2 borefest. Just ignore that now, please mr director."
RP having power issues. Hope none of the other mercs do
Please no more than 8 races...
It's time sky and F1 hire new casters / commentators. The amount of wrong calls / observations already is abysmal. They can't even identify drivers correctly. We're not even at half race distance.
Albon is in no way better then Gasly in the Red Bull
Does Hamilton have a higher mode than Bottas? Are merc not giving Bottas the same engine mode?
Lewis you fraud
Where are the grid girls?
[deleted]
Who didn't kneel?
Bullshit penalty. Ham left the space.
[deleted]
Oh...what a shame the protesters have fallen away.
BREAKING NEWS: Vettel crashed into a Ferrari motor home!
Ban Hamilton Out of F1
"What a joke, Albon fucks up and Hamilton gets punished."
That was completely Albon. What are you guys smoking
"Man people love to just hate on Hamilton, if you objectively look at the on-board it’s super easy to see that it wasn’t Albons fault and it wasn’t Hamilton’s fault. Hamilton is already in the corner so he can’t change anything and Albon made a great move to pass him mid turn, unfortunately both of them were stuck."
"The stewards better not shit out another penalty vs HAM

THAT WAS RACING. period."
"I mean, they couldnt have choosen Spa for 2 races? Shitty Austria. But atleast its not France."
Lewis goat like
[deleted]
Good job max was here to race and didn't let anything else distract him.
[deleted]
"People not wearing masks correctly even in F1 garages, dissapointing"
[deleted]
"So which ones didn't kneel? 

I spotted Sainz and Max."
Let's go Lewis!
Everyone remember that Red Bull self-inflicted hype train just days ago? What a bunch of wankers.
Bottles is bang average in races man.
[deleted]
[removed]
YES! Take that ICameHereToRaceMax.
pretty done with lewis hamilton in this sport. what a toxic individual plagueing our great f1.
"Let's go, happy to see F1 again...
I wish an memorable race without politics."
[deleted]
Now to catch Max
Ha. Should have kneeled Max.
I am starting to think that Max is not the Honda Whisperer after all?
"How was Vettel's stint at Ferrari compared to Alonso?

Did he manage to get it to the last race with a shot at the title at least once?"
It's not a GP without Grosjean Grosjeaning it
Magnussen the torpedo
Typical Seb
Haas doing Haas things
Albon fucks up his own podium again.
"Man fuck Hamilton, what a piece of shit"
That's a definite penalty for HAM
5 sec is a joke
Lmao red bull get fucked
That is a bullshit 5 second penalty
"Eat it, HAM"
"Protest all you want, you can't even take care of your own cars."
For Leclerc to be a future champion he is still quite far away on race pace
"Definitely some Karma working against Verstappen and Red Bull, there."
"I don’t understand how Bottas had a 11 second lead on Hamilton earlier until an incident occurred and the safety car came out, how is that fair should they not keep the same distance between them even when the safety is out? At the same time it’s making the end of this race interesting, come on Albon!!"
Oh come on Albon. What kind of naive move is that.
"Lewis gave Albon enough space into the corner and steered hard right all the way through, that's a racing incident"
MY BODY IS READY
Bruh why is Valterri red?
I wouldn't be shocked if Norris leads after the first lap tbh. Neither Bottas nor Verstappen have shown to be particularly good starters
"I hope the race is good. Else, I'm watching Tremors in my rec room."
No love for Perez
"**WE'RE ROLLING, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN**"
Poor Lewis
"No crowds. 

Camera director has no excuse to pan to the crowd in The middle of an overtake now!!!"
What are those puffs of smoke coming from the Racing Points? Engine issues already?
Stream?
Its literally impossible to tell who is who from the 6 white cars.
"Did stroll 
take a bit off ricciardos wing in the second corner?"
Brundle surprised by McLaren and Red Bull being faster McLaren lol
Painful indeed
Show us interval times not the leaders
Ocon has been disappointing so far
does anybody know if Mercedes deployed das yesterday? did they use it in quali?
THE POWER OF DREAMS
Schadenfreude
Lmao rbr did the absolute most just for that to happen
And the only way this race was gonna be interesting is gone.See ya next race guys
"After they did Vettel dirty, I'm really loving seeing Ferrari fighting for 1 point"
Noooooooo
Honda were going to Honda it up at some point.
LMAO
Just finished drinking a can of Monster. Give me another one please.
"PODIUM FOR ALBON, calling it now"
Karma for appealing
Gp2
Karma
You hate to see it😂😂
Ver :(((((((((
Guess we get to watch the two Mercedes fight it out for first this year. Hope they show more midfield battle.
Lmao that shot of verstappen all alone
Oh this season is going to be FUN /s
"God max has been absolutely fucked today, madness"
That fuckin sucks
Karma is a bitch
LOL
LIVE TIMING down for anyone else?
Bottas will let Hamilton pass by now.
Karma is bitch!
Albon podium incoming though :D
OMG! Ocon just passed someone
Well that explains Stroll's pace....
Cancel the season. Worst possible outcome so far.
"What's your race of choice? NASCAR, MotoGP or M1-2?"
GO GO GO GO GO WHO’S NEXT
nooooo ricciardo!
Albon is gone
WTF is happening?????
Realiability bugs comming out for allot of teams in the first race.
ALBON OUT???
Where is Albon?
"Grosjean, visiting the gravel for a pint...."
Grosjean again 😂😂😂
Grosjean going off track? Classic.
Ffs not you too lance
Bye bye stroll
lmaooooo romain
I think Ericsson hit him.
Lol stroll’s acting like he was on P1
"Looks like Ferrari is playing the long game, considering their engine is the only one that hasn't died yet."
Least shocking retirement of the day that
LOL lettuce boy is poo poo
Its nice to see Ocon sucking that hard
Of course Hamilton will win. Of course
Merc is just unfair.
"Imagine being French, Imagine your car being less reliable than **BOTH WILLIAMS CARS.**"
Hahahaas
Magnussen wat r u do
WTF did KMag just miss the turn?
Nice overtake by Esteban
Bottas is fucked. Now Lewis just needs to lay back and let Bottas panick and wreck he tyres like he usually does
When the pit stop is the best part of the race so far
Perez penalty for sure
ahhhhhhhhhh
Something tells me this is something that Ferrari needed.
This will help Bottas I think
Vettelspin returns!
Classic Vettel
Vettel kekw
Ferrari 😂
SPINELLAAAAAA
Just retire. Don’t bother coming back.
"Thank fucking god we're getting rid of #5, just can't stop spinning at every race"
Lmaoo get this amateur out of here. Vettel should have retired so long ago
"Vettel is so washed man.

That legit is a rookie mistake"
I just laughed out loud at VET
With that car is Vettel even going to be able to get back into the points from 15th?
Anyone got links to the long runs from free practice? Was Valtteri very quick on hards from memory? It was medium that Lewis was quick oN
What is going on 😂
Seb done well not to hit him there.
Good thing that it doesnt even matter this season for ferrari
"Russell in P12, not a bad day so far."
Russell sneaking his way towards the points
F1 is really back. Vettel still spinning
Try spinning that works.
"Something something something metaphor for Seb's Ferrari career. 

Wow, spiciest battle of the race was from Lando & Sergio out the pits! 

Things I expect from Drive to Survive season 3 episode 1: 

  * Mr. Steiner's famous calm, zen-like response to both HAAS spinning within a lap of each other. 

  * Cyril hand-waving.

  * Smug Horneyman"
vettel should just stop giving a fuck and start to cut corners and push others off track
YES SERGIOOO
"seb man, not this season too"
I thought it looked like Sainz’s error but I’m happy to be proved wrong.
"If you get your lap deleted in the race then it shouldn't be just the time, should be the distance too"
"On the bright side, Albon's gonna get his first podium today!"
PER and ALB same pace
Latifi got no chill
Ocons Renault sounds crazy. Reminds me of the old  traction control sound.
Did Danil get some vodka during his stop? Wtf is that speed trap?
Latifi must be in last years car
Albon win pls
"Valterri, IT’s jAmEs"
Hoping Mercedes flies a little too close to the sun 👀
Petition to make badder the right word
Ocon is doing well but I can’t let go the time he crashed max out for trying to unlap himself & was super weird about it 😂
What is Vettel doing? Did he forget it's a race?
"What are you doing Romain?

Edit - What are you doing Haas?"
"Vettel can't overtake a Williams, lmao"
Nooo George :(
Grosjean is literally useless
How is Grosjean still in F1? He's so shit.
Grosjean off AGAIN?!?
Pit for softs
"Race literally finished on ~Lap 45. What a show, great return F1."
"Grosjean hurts my brain, how is he still in this sport? 🤦🏼‍♂️"
Watch Hamilton take the win now
"Feel sad for Russell, but... I hope the SC does something to make this race a good opener, because for now, the season could've stayed on hold and I wouldn't have had a problem seeing this would've been the result."
I know people are going to laugh because of how Seb messed up but does Seb have a shot at points now he has fresh softs?
"Latifi already destroying Russell, can't believe he finished 20th last year and was kept instead of Kubica /s"
"Look, there is a 3rd Ferrari monopost parked in the hills!"
Why did Sky just give airtime to idiotic fans not socially distancing?..
Perez please just let ALBON through
Wtf kimi
I think perez got the back just at the right time
What in the ever flying fuck
What a shitshow.
Kind of a crazy tether failure gotta say you might want to look into that one...
What the fuck just happened? The tether came off
"Oh.... the tether failed?

EDIT: Even more WTF, it just came off"
Fuck this race :(
Ferrari powered cars having the best weekend ever. I am surprised that both Ferraris are still in the race
"Critical issue with the merc gear box ? , Why are they asked to stay off the curves ?"
come on Albon!!
"come the f*** on, bring in the SC!!!!"
Hope Albon gives Lewis a shunt for Brazil last year.
Come on Albon
LETS GO ALEX
Cmon Alex!
FUCKING LEWIS
LMFAO ALBON AHAH
Hamilton is such a sore loser my god
ughhhh noooooo
Lewis didn’t even turn
CHECO
Fuck me that's a tough one
Verstappen woulda completed that pass
"That should be a drive through, not a time penalty.

That’s fucking ridiculous."
Albon was ahead
deja vu
HISTORY REPEAT ITSELF
Brazil again lol
"Daily Fail preparing its next headline : ""LEWIS HATES ALBON"""
Fuck Hamilton
Albon did the same move to Hamilton earlier in the race except HAM avoided contact.
Albon what the hell was that?
He couldve waited... Cmon albon
Hamilton DNF would be so much karma I couldn't handle it
I wish karma acts and ham engine goes poof
Norris getting a podium if Hamilton gets a penalty
Dumb move by Albon. Put himself at risk for no reason.
"watching sky, Albon has no one to blame but himself"
This kinda turns me against Lewis now...
COME ON CHARLES
CHARLES TO THE PODIUM!
Thats norris m8
Norris has poor race craft. 1-2 more laps and he could’ve caught Perez.
bets on FIA acting in favour of HAM
allez charles!
Leclerc podium please.
Lewis is getting a penalty and Ferrari might somehow get a podium. Wtf!
Leclerc on the podium with hamilton's ban
Leclerc Just showed you all why Ferrari went all in with him instead of Vettel.
So Perez is gonna lose power isint he
Leclerc on podium?
Albon must be fucking fuming again. Literally twice
Poor lando :/
CHARLES TAKE MY ENERGY!
"Podium as it stands is 2020 Mercedes, 2020 Mercedes, and 2019 Mercedes"
Once again Vettel could have been in a great position if he didn't make a mistake
Wow leclerc
Leclerc is showing that he has that Alonso fighting spirit
Nice move charles
LECLERCCCCC
What a dive Charles!
FORZAAAA CHARLESSSS
ONLY 5 SECONDS??
Mercedes WCC title is in danger. Ferrari is here. 😎
MY BABY BOI LEGLERG
YES get rekt lewis
5 seconds. YES YES YES.
yessss
LMAO
LOL
LOL
"YESSSS NO HAM WIN

REJOICE!!!!"
Awesome!!!
"LOL, 5 seconds for Ham"
Hamilton out of the podium. Pls pls
"What a dive-bomb, unreal"
Leclerc 2012 Alonso?
glad fia is siding with albon. Means what albon tried was a good move and not something stupid. He could have waited and be more safe but still
yeeeees 5 secs penalty
"Good, Albon was up against the outside kerb, Hamilton purposely overdrove the corner."
Hahaha Lewis!! Get in there guy
5 second penalty actually pretty brutal here in terms of points potentially
That is the epitome of bullshit
Ferrari overtake a Mercedes!
Waiting for the Merc fanbois coming with their excuses.
HAM trying to take some dirty tricks from the Senna and Schumacher playbooks.
RB is the real shit box. Fucking garbage car.
ALEX NOOOOO
Lando Podium?!!!
lol perez got a penalty for speeding in the pitlane
Typical Perez stuff right there.
Checo just threw away a podium.
"A 5 sec penalty for ham is just ridiculous honestly, for just shunting someone out the way for overtaking your precious ego?"
Will they even investigate Lando's move on Perez?
I think lewis could've easily won this bar the issues and a bullshit penalty
WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING!!!!
Please tell me that Lando gets 3rd.
"Haha, suck it Albon!"
"You need to learn from that, Alex"
Such a fucking sloppy ass race. It's pretty obvious now that they should've given all of the teams a few weeks to get their shit in order before restarting the season.
Leclerc and Norris are my only hope now. fucking hell. Albon stop where a saftey car has to come out please!!!!!! Fuck Lewis and Mercedes for this shit!!
Yes LANDOOOO
IM CRYING!!!! LANDO YESSSSSS
WHAT A RACE MY GOD
Ngw3yj3k6ejymhdmheejykyengsgnsngsgnsgnwgnw
The Sky commentators are such shits. Saying Merc should let HAM past BOT to protect him from NOR.
"Congrats VB! Tough luck for Lewis, but extremely happy for Lando."
That fuckin last safety car stayed too long. Additional 3 laps would be better
Lewis is gonna mad at Merc..
"Norris is meh, Hamilton got what he deserves at least."
All i see is Rolex
"Karma for red bull.

RIP"
Go Lewis! Get revenge for the way Bottas stole your place!
Idiotic from Albon there. Thrown away a podium and a massive lead on him team mate
"Just tuned in, so no one kneeled? Not even Lewis who I though would.      
       
Edit: lol getting downvoted for asking a question when I only saw the last 15 seconds of the Austrian anthem"
He should have knelt down
Fuck red bull are embarrassing. 3 seconds behind? With their budget why have they done nothing??
The FIA are desperate to hamper Hamilton. Feel like I'm in 2005
"As an Indycar fan where P1 isn't secured in the first 1/4 of the first lap, and understanding Mercedes has an incredible advantage, this will be. Boring. Why bother watching? Where is the entertainment value? Further back? All this $ for a parade? The sheer pace is incredible. Makes most other race cars look slow."
Worst multiple world champion in history.  LOL!
Just 5 second penalty for Hamilton? Why even do that? Why not just hand him the championship already and ask other drivers to race for the 2nd spot all season? And why no safety car for all the incidents in the 70th lap? Just to protect Hamilton's position?
[deleted]
"Max took an arrow to the knee and thus had to kneel in the end


Karma for Horner RIP"
"Why do so many people use F1TV lol? Just use your domestic sport tv provider (i.e. Sky Sports F1), unless your country doesn't broadcast it then RIP"
"Yes yes yes yes yes!

The curse continues!"
Anything that spoils Mr Ginger Spice's day makes mine.
Dutch tears.
Come on Merc and Perez!
"Cant really punish Lewis for that, would be bad PR at a time like this"
That's an outrageous penalty. That's horrendous.
Thank God that kneeling nonsense is over. Keep that shit in the US please.
"""Little bit of luck"" yeah sure, keep telling yourself that Ferrari. Without 2 safety cars there was no way you would have been on the podium. Even then it was through some bullshit circumstances"
Well deserved to Red Bull throwing s***t to Merc with the referees
It's amazing how Red Bull can do as bad as Ferrari and avoid criticism.
"The Merc is unreliable as fuck. Like 2014, it's fast but unreliable"
Ready for downvotes but I would feel worse for Max  right now if he had kneeled
"lmao British media implying Seb spun on his own when he braked late and Sainz gave him no room, so he had to slow even more"
Who’s the random on the side?
"Giving Albon the position is wrong, Perez was ahead, I’m sure of it."
Karma for not kneeling lmao
Vettle is done
Sebastian has great nerves when he has tha fastest car and slowest team mate. Other than that well...
Why does Hamilton want to stop the only other minority on the grid from getting any podiums?
[deleted]
That was not a penalty. Rodiculous this 5 seconds penalty.
"KING BOTTAS@@@@@

Lewis didnt deserve penalty, neither did perez"
[removed]
oh no vettel is a out of the grand prix. its pretty bad at red bull
"Vettels pace is so bad compared to leclerc. On top of that, he keeps locking up with errors"
Bottas is useless
"Let's be honest, it would be a better story for BLM if Lewis won today, despite everything"
"How is Red Bull a front running team, 2 seconds behind Mercedes already after 5 laps. If it was Ferrari everyone would be shitting on them"
Any live stream ?
"""Calm look of supremacy"" - Crofty white supremacist confirmed"
A Renault-engined car not having good race pace?! Shocker.
Too many white liveries to easily distinguish cars from distance
GOTTEM
What happened to ferrari? They used to be at least competitive for top 3...
There's one thing being shown up in the midfield but now Stroll is gonna get shown up with the third fastest car on the grid. Really gonna put a spotlight on his performances now
Maybe Red Bull can cry to the stewards? Worked an hour ago
YYYESSSSSSSSS SIIIUUUUUU BYE MAX
[deleted]
Should have kneeled you twat
Albon or lando podium is probably the only saving grace of this race
This is heart breaking.
...... :)
Austria too hot for f1
Now Magnussen goess off track. Him and Grosjean like boiling up Gunther
I love haas just not having drivers lol
"~~Perez not pitting?????~~

Jk I'm dumb. Interesting to see if those mediums last"
When are they gonna stop explaining DAS
"2-3 laps for a SC is ridiculous, let them race damnit!"

"Sainz taking Vettel out, lol"
"What a fantastic race and we are not even half way through!

Midfield so close and good fight up front brewing between teammates!"
"I would enjoy a battle, but for bottas sake I would also enjoy ham having to stand down"
"Cross fingers, for the 2 mercs to crash like back in 16', getting lando and alex their first podium and Perez his due deserve and russell his first point"
2ND RACISM
You come at the king you best not UTTERLY BUGGER IT UP Alex
YESSSS LETS GO LEWIS!
Then at least we have a Perez podium?
hamiltons fault cleary. what a shame albon was ahead
"Give Lewis a fucking stop go for that shit, come on."
Leclerc with a shitbox car
DESERVES EVERY MILLISECOND
5 seconds kind of harsh penalty?
HAMILTON TIME PENALTYYYYY
FIVE SECKONDS IS A YOKE
Can Hamilton hit Albon every race please???
Revenge is sweet meal... Hamilton
"How does a six time world champion make such a rookie error? Damn shame for albon.
And than his engine goes busy damned sham."
Suck it tracing point.
"Nice for Norris!! Is he going anywhere next year?

Such an undeserced podium for Leclerc"
AnOtHeR MeRcEdEs 1-2 BoRiNg RaCe

Lewis Hamilton seven-time world champion has such a nice ring to it.
"If Hamilton asks for a pass on Bottas then I will lose a lot of respect for him.

He won't, I'm sure, but I really hope it doesn't happen.

Still, screw Merc for taking the race away from us."
Hamilton did nothing wrong!
Go Max ... easily the No1 driver on the grid ... He would destroy Ham and Bottas if he had a Merc
Maybe Max should've took a knee earlier
[removed]
"A) Fuck Bottas. He did it on purpose. 

B) LOOOL Racing Points battling Ferrari xD Feels bad not being able to cheat, eh?"
Lewis for the win
Max losing power. Love to see it
HAHAHA fuck Red Bull
COME ON! Seeya Max.
"LIFT ME UP LIFT ME UP

HIGHER NOW RARAMBA"
LOL Haas drivers are a joke.
Haas has the 2 worst drivers of the grid.
How is Norris 12th? When did that happen??
I just hope Sergios tyres dont last long
Bottas getting cucked?

"Boring race, fuck this. I'd rather have no F1 again."
"I do not understand the hype, someone explain?"
Unlucky for Lewis. Missed out by 0.2secs but at least he took Albon out of the podium so i’ll gladly take the result.
"I wish we could get rid of masks soon, really doesn't look nice"
Come on Bottas beat this racist prick
Has botas ever won a gp?
"A bit sad about Hamilton. So close to holding the podium; maybe Bottas should have let him go ahead of him to get some clear air to maintain 3rd. 

That being said, pretty excited for Lando and McLaren.

Edit: Jeez, guys I'm not saying Lewis didn't deserve the penalty. He did. Sucks for Albon. I'm referring to benefits to Mercedes after the Lewis error. If you let Ham go past and open up the gap on Lando, Bottas still retains 1st and Ham holds 3rd. 

That will benefit Mercedes bin the constructors."
"I was about to say, lol. HELP."
They had the whole off-season to work on their streaming infrastructure and it’s still not able to deal with the load; they better extend subscriptions again because this is ridiculous.
"Tried logging in again, reinstalling, watching on the web. Ended up watching an illegal stream tuning in just in time for the first corner.

Absolutely horrendous service."
"Yup, same here"
F1TV: letting you down when you need it most
Second that
"It's redirecting me to the main stream now, with very low quality. I already see the main stream on TV, I subscribed for the onboards and other extras. I'm going to ask for my money back. Mostly out of spite."
HOLY SHIT IT LOADED LETS GOOOOO
F1 TV not working :(
Same here.
F1 TV is back for me!
"The Android App works reliably for me, the website does not."
"arrrrr, working fine"
Please everyone vote the app 1 star and plummet its ratings
"missed the start because of that, such a load of crap. To me the very start to the first corner is probably THE most exciting part of the race and the piss poor F1TV (as per usual) ruined it."
"No kidding, I tried to go legit this year instead of watching pirate streams but F1 tv wouldn't even load to take my money..."
I got up early and still missed the first 14 minutes of the race.
I was finally able to watch the stream when Verstappen was in the pits retiring from the race
works for me perfectly
Literally the entire half end of the mercs
"Bono with the heat: ""that's the red and white ones as well"""
And exactly nothing happened. As is tradition
Meme 👏🏻 Race 👏🏻
"not just robbed, but by Hamilton again. That video the other day with the Imperial March theme was fucking on point."
The best meme ever!
Lmfao
1-2 go bye bye!
seb never disappoints
Just. Saw the footage of him fighting the car. It seems unstable while braking as well as corners. Something went very wrong.
He might have broadcast to both at once
😂
"No chance, sasquatch wachoo got"
This aged well
"God: ""okay"""
fucking lol
Oof...
Only because it was Latifi
Lol
They are dead in the water. It’s a real shame but it’s what it is
"Well, about that lol"
This aged quite nicely
It's really disheartening really.
Haas looking like focking vankers
McLaren podium though!
Leclerc pulls p2 out of fuckin nowhere
Can you start wishing for a mercedes win?
">ferrari fucking die

About that."
"""maybe Bottas can keep at least the title race interesting"" 

Hamilton gets penalty place and stills win

It is like we never left 2019"
"> ferrari fucking die

Ferrari finished P2! I think people are too eager to declare things are all over, see this thread: ""oh another Mercedes 1,2"" how about waiting for the chequered flag?"
"I feel stupid for expecting that Formula 1 will be good in 2020.

Not only it's 2020 but it was already a lot of disappointments in last season."
F1 returns like it's 1999
The fact that it changed colour filters to slightly greyer when showing on boards during the montage was hilarious to me
It's shit the bed for you as well has it? Can't believe I got up at 5:30am and am paying for this shit.
board the high seas
My stream looked like it was being played from a corrupt VHS tape lol
I might rip my cock off from jerking off if that happens
I could die a happy man
Yes
Remember the time Kimi won and it was the more glided thread on Reddit? This is how history can repeat
Is there a minimum crew requirement?
I concur
"Grosjean said that in the last laps he was lifting 400m before the apex to let the car coast... If they have to do this again next week, I fully expect them to end behind the Williams, even if they don't have to retire."
"Right as Hamilton was going to pass Albon. Seriously, couldn't have waited a bit."
"Yah, it was so obvious that this will be the exciting corner..."
Kubica 20th to 10th at Germany last year.
Two more retirements and he'll be in the points!
Beating his more experienced team mate. Good on him.
Last Germany had points
Great debut race for sure.
"Kubica scored a point last season, so no!"
Did everyone miss that Russel was in 12th on merit before his day went to shit or something?
He finished 11th
And RedBull. Good episode.
Imagine the scenes
Oh my goodness.
Feels like a pre-written script tbh!
Mercedes 1-4 👍
/r/agedlikemilk
Ferrari 2nd place!
"Fucking hell, they've had so much time to get their shit fixed, but instead they seem to hire ex-Ferrari engineers for their servers."
Yes it's down
It's down. Pre-race show has been cancelled and no doubt we'll miss the start of the race - again.
Working for me on their Roku app.
cant get it either wooooo
"Same, it's not working for me on my browser but the mobile app works"
It isn't working for me either
"New to the subscription service, is this common?"
This is why I’m holding off from buying lol. Hopefully they get their shit together fast and soon.
I managed to get it to load after refreshing a hundred times. Just keep on refreshing and DONT TOUCH ANYTHING if it loads haha
works for me perfectly
"YEP. I login, try to watch the race, and it tells me to subscribe. I am already subscribed to F1 TV Pro. Other times, the stream will load blank. And sometimes, it just gives me a ""something went wrong"" error code. I've tried on Chrome, Safari, and iOS mobile app"
"F1 TV isn't working for me this morning. My subscription shows as active, but the broadcast page won't load. I will be very annoyed if I can't watch the race."
Same in the southwest US. It's buggered.
Yeah same here
"Same here. It will load intermittently, but I can't get the stream running"
"Yep, am fuming."
"Same here, if I try to load the video URL directly (to be able to use AirPlay), I even get an access denied error. This was working yesterday."
Same in Canada
Yep. This is really annoying
Same in Portugal
F1 TV not working :(
I was sooo close to getting a f1TV subscription. Glad went with Disney-Hotstar here is India.
This is the way
Why did we miss this sport again?
Loving it
Rus could be in the points!
Zak Brown attaching magnets to Albon's and Hamilton's cars lmao
Comment of the day
What a lap that was. I was screaming for Lando at the end.
Milk?
I think your thinking of Indy car racing.. It's champaign here!
Well almost lol
One got sacrificed so the other could P3
You get one and precisely one of those.
We need those sausages everywhere!
Not 14 anymore
That aren't doing anything either. It's a procession. Take a moment to look at the gaps.
Life is cruel
At least no one's on fire
technically nothing too crazy really happened
This race will be forgotten about in a few weeks
"The only interesting part is that there are so many retirements. The racing, especially at the front is pretty lack luster."
and both didn't get on a real podium
Albon died so McLaren could live
Alb replaced massa lol

Same. I’m on USA.
"Same, app’s stuck on a spinning Pirelli"
Same issues here
Same issues. Where is another place I can watch?
Last year was largely fine for me. This year they obviously have to contend with a ton more people stuck at home at a point where F1 seems to be gaining in popularity again. They need to dump massive amounts of money in F1TV upgrades this week.
Let's see if Ham agrees to it :D
"That was a secret team orders code at RB, I hear?"
Exactly
HAHAHAHAHA
Brilliant. Memes coming in a minute
I spit out my goddamned coffee at this. Bravo.
"More like ""Drive To The Pits"""
Are they doing another season?
Are they Even allowed At the Track because of COVID?
That was too cute lol
"Yep... I said it last night... With chaos + Lec can bring it home, we can get podium"
Just like Brazil. Albon died so Sainz could live there
"Russell died to put Albon in the position to die to put Lando on the podium.

My beautiful, beautiful boys."
McLaren owed him twice.
As a non-Red Bull fan I can get behind sacrificing Albon for Hamilton penalties and McLaren podiums.
First ten laps made me worry it would be a boring race but god was i wrong.
"Lewis deserves to lose his spot, what an arse. Then Lando gets fastest lap!"
"Me too, and I'm a Hamliton fan. But this was stupid."
*from a long time Hamilton fan
"They aren’t all like this one. Some are incredibly boring. But every know and then we get a race Iike today’s and it’s worth it. 

What I’m saying is, don’t be discouraged if the next one isn’t as great.  They’ll be a another great one eventually."
Me too!
Well Austria is known for having its drama. Some tracks *cough* France *cough cough* are just terrible and boring. Glad you liked it
Except the sun is still up!
Love to see it!
So pumped for Lando!!
I imagine the team atmosphere is a huge reason behind their 2019 (and hopefully 2020!) successes
"Can you blame him?

When a multi-time World Champion keeps nerfing you away from your first podium..."
F1 TV isn't working for me
I have sky sports and am considering buying a nowtv day pass as my kid is peacefully watching something
Where are you getting a stream? Motorsportstreams I can’t find any at all!
Not to mention mercedes 1-2
"I don't think any of those were the engines, but the systems connected to them"
Mercedes dominating
This is 4 months of F1 absence in one race
"I wish this turns out to be a generic race, Hamilton off the podium for once."
Don't forget the Mercedes 1-2.
"How could you forget a Merc 1-2? Other than that, yeah it’s been pretty basic."
Within the first quarter of the race too
It helps when other teams have problems
"I can confirm it is great indeed, #blessed"
This didn’t age well lol.
It's really fucking boring honestly since being at the top ALL the time makes success uninteresting
Don't blame Mercedes when other teams were napping since 2014.
"Like supporting GSW couple of years ago in nba, just way too op. not fun for anyone"
Stop it. He's dead already
"Finished ahead of Latifi in his debut. That's it. The only way he got to the points was by 5 driver retirements ahead of him. Giovinazzi passed him on track towards the end of the race. That is one of the worst performances I've seen from Vettel. Absolutely brutal. He's looking unqualified for a Haas drive, much less a Mercedes."
"Both Haas retiring in the first race of the season due to the same issue, wait wasn’t that the first episode of drive to survive?"
I got a feeling Kimi is only racing this year for the free ice cream
It's free real estate!
Yes
And hear Toto wolf tell the drivers to stay off the curbs!
Yes
"Seems it, I cannot remember when I last seen another car. Vettle is in drs of russell, let us watch that instead of bottas and Hamilton's grand tour of spielberg"
Welcome to your new addiction! You chose a great F1 race to just start watching!
This was a bananas race. Usually they are exciting but not because cars are blowing up and tires are flying off. The passing was excellent this race tho. Welcome aboard!
Same. First one I’ve ever watched start to finish. Fucking crazy shit
Welcome to F1! hahahah
"Might've had to retire anyway, but man, Lewis drives like Albon killed his dog."
Ikr
Looks like he wouldve had it for sure
some hot garbage from Mercedes there
Fuck those fake fans.
"To be fair, it looked like it would be about midway through"
And Ferrari be in the midfield lol
Yeah man i was really rooting for him so that we south east asian finally has one podium in f1
"So am I man, so am I. Let's find some solace with lando though."
He'll drive the pants off that thing
Fuck yes.
pretty clearly was having trouble hearing him.  asked him to repeat it initially.
Almost :(
Where do you find this information?
They should put those 360 degree bumpers around Hamilton's car from go karts that automatically slow you down when you're about to crash into someone.
"The other way round man, the other way round :/"
Just another day in F1 racing!
Let's be honest we would rather have Bottas Win over Hamilton here. Bottas is a good driver and a good respectable guy.
It's a bit difficult to get excited about a Merc win.
Should’ve been him there !! I really like Norris but man that was albon’s podium
I love the solid smack he gave it on the podium.
You're not alone !!!!
It was super nice to finally jump around in excitement from a sport
"Yup, can't load the site. Get a 404 error when trying to go to the live video."
same
r/ABoringDystopia
That's the nature of this sub unfortunately. Many people with a short attention span and jumping to conclusions way too quickly. The closest thing to a solution I found so far for myself is to not follow the live threads too closely so I won't get dragged down with all the negativity and simply enjoy the racing.
You mean before a bunch of safety cars?
"We're still relying on breakdowns, penalties, and safety cars, though. If this was an uneventful race, we would have just watched Mercedes win by 15 seconds over 3rd."
[deleted]
Plot twists no one saw coming. Needs more Michael Bay though
Yes. I'm panicking!

welcome back lmao

F1 TV not working :(
"Now now, bottas is ahead of Hamilton. The dust has not settled"
"Hamilton off the podium baby, Leclerc somehow bringing the shitbox to p2, and Norris managing to gain over half a second in the last lap to take the podium from Hamilton.

F1 is fucking back and better than ever."
Welcome back.
And a Redbull engine failure
"Seb spinning, Williams off the points, Hamilton complaining..."
I guess someone at Ferrari took the phrase 'slow and steady wins the race' too literally.
Same here
I’m panicking!
Same here. Argh.
"Yeah, just shitting the bed for me."
My Dyson sounds better
Not enough social distancing.
"It’s nothing to do with that 😂 Doesn’t matter that we’re in July, the fact is it’s the first race of the season."
I want to live in this timeline.
"P11, so close"
Big oof
"I feel so fucking bad for Russell right now. He was doing so bloody well.

Heres hoping he can do as well if not better next week, he certainly deserves it. Poor lad."
As Sainz did in Brazil :D
Big if true
I would go as fast as to say of the entire decade.
"I don't recall having any issues last year. But so far I've had issues with FP2, Qualy, and now the Race."
Its the 3rd year already and still the same shit service. I have no other choice to watch F1 so i have to buy F1TV every year.
Not working for me also...
It's working for me since the last 13 minutes
"9 cars out, Williams still no points lol."
"Yeah it's fucked.

Bullshit service."
Yep
yes of course :/
yep. quite irate.
yes completely fucked.
Not working for me too
"yep, dead here to :("
Ive got F1TV android app working. Weird. This is fukt
Jep. As is tradition by now.
"It’s like they take 90% of the money and just pocket it, and spend nothing on the servers"
"Ah yes, the Alonso special"
This aged badly
This aged well
Would be absolutely insane!
i can only get so erect
I'd love an Albon or Perez victory
"If my maths is right, McLaren with 3rd and 5th would be joint 1st place with Racing Point in the constructors championship..."
Completely agree. They lie constantly. Try to get other teams to stay off the kerbs
Fingers crossed
The ferrari came alive on low fuel.
He's definitely got the hunger and mental fortitude.
Yep same.
Where did you find any stream?
Can you send me a link? Fucking F1TV seriously
Championship chance already destroyed.
Feels like that it never left.
I can subscribe to that!
Then who is Formula 1.5?
Inject that right into my veins now!
"Norris, albon, perez please"
yes please.
Lmao
Might just quit F1 if that happens
Albon probably thought that his own overtake was under safety car already
Maybe Perez was ahead when the SC came out
"Hey, don't forget, Vettel is nearly in the points. It isn't so bad for Ferrari, yet."
"Lmao I was thinking the same thing, it's too bad they didn't add one of those dramatic piano tunes to it haha"
👍
I would have been surprised otherwise
YEEEEEEA!
Hats off to the kid. As furious as I was for a 5 second penalty it’s nice to see someone really race to win the position.
I said the exact same thing
He did
Yep on the last lap
"Yes he did, so that and the top ten finish is the extra point right?"
yea
Yup
He did
"Max is starting the 2nd race will a 2 goal disadvantage to make it a 3-way title fight, but perhaps Lewis being 5th softens that blow a bit.

Bottas did very well today and has his biggest chance yet to get the title."
lol
May be they figured out the only way to get reliable engine is to make it slow
The joke is behind the wheel at Ferrari.
I beg to differ
I honestly thought his engine broke down.
"probably not, having sensor issues from sensors being jolted when the cars hit kerbs"
"""Stay off the kerbs"" - racing line is not for you"
As usual a Mercedes is continuously leading the race.
Albon just took it back.
Perfect
"🎶...In the arms of the angels, far away from here...🎶"
So much drama
This is fucking shite. Only drama and no racing.
everyone is a winner!!!
Made their car in the tractor plant.
Hamilton off the podium.
Lol I can't tell if this is pro norris or anti
And there were no real crashes! WTF
Agent Sainz was on it today.
"LIFT ME UP LIFT ME UP

HIGHER NOW RARAMBA"
and this is one of the worse races! You’re gonna enjoy it when it gets good!
I'm in the same boat! This is fun!

Wouldn't even be mad if they did this sometimes
"Lol, I'm also sitting here wondering how long till Merc succumbs to Hamilton's winging and tell Bottas to let him pass."
"Just like every first race in a season, really. Just in July."
NOT FERRARI
Crash noises and explosions everywhere!
LMAO
All apart of the plan
Luck? This is art.
For real
"Makes me appreciate safety cars actually, this would have been a very different story without them."
I think Seb passed on the right and Kvyat's rear left failed
I thought it might have been dust/ gravel from the outside of the track after perhaps a slight contact
Teams would just make more stable cars. Really wouldn't change much
I wonder if that wouldn't cause more safety cars than what we had.

"Seb's ~~tyre advantage is~~ gone, fuck.

FTFY"
Goddamnit
Hahaha
"nice sense of humour, latifi will need it at the end of the race"
I never expected so much from Little Latifi
Sounds like a fly getting choked.
"Yeah, they fucked up microphones position... Mercedes' sounds like Honda's engines now too."
Hahaha
Gotta make up for less races in the season
I am the one who saves Williams. - Latifi
"The way he's been driving, he might as well be 20th."
Completely different incidents.
"He had his steering wheel as far to the right as possible, looks like it was understeer"
"Lando threw everything at that last lap, holy shit"
Fastest lap top I think
*casually rams P3 sign*
He just booped it gently.
Part of their master plan. I had no doubts! Vettel could have been P3 had it not been for his spin! 😅
"nope. 

this was some mario kart shit."
No
"It depends. You usually don't have such mayhem. But that's F1. Even when the top 2 cars are so far ahead of the pack, craziness can still happen!"
"Unfortunately no, not to this level of madness LOL"
"No haha. Though it depends on the season and the track! The Mercedes duo zipping off ahead of everyone else is unfortunately very familiar feeling. But the rest of the grid is far more evenly matched than they have been in years.

The reliability was unusually bad today but this sort of thing happens sometimes and is always entertaining. The 1996 Monaco GP famously only had 3 cars cross the finish line."
"All auto racing can be hit-and-miss.  Sometimes its like this, sometimes its a sleeper.  The thing thats helped me as a newer fan is watching the netflix f1 show, seeing just how much every single position means to the drivers and teams.  So even when theres no drama at the front of the field i can still be entertained knowing how hard those mid-field teams are fighting each other."
"No, but sometimes is even better!"
"Sometimes. Usually its entertaining from a purely strategic and skill point of view, but every once in a while we get these races that are entertaining purely due to chaos."
"It can be, Austria is usually a great race. Luckily we’ll be back here next week"
"Unfortunately, no. But there's always one or two really entertaining one in a season."
Hell no (besides wet races). This was AMAZING
"Not usually, you've been spoiled. What a first race to watch though!"
We welcome you! I must say this was an exceptionally exciting end of the race but this sport in general will keep you on the edge of your seat
Really depends.  Last year we had some crazy races too though.  Off the top of my head Austria and Germany were pretty insane.  So was Brazil.
Nope. This was a really weird race.
"No unfortunately, todays race was insane"
"To be honest, no, but there is always a chance"
"Well,no. It’s usually Mercedes 1-2, with them just cruising at the front"
"If bad shit like this keep on happening, usually the race will be fairly interesting like last year's German GP. I think this race is almost up there with 2019 German GP"
Uh...
Did they just nap during the odd season? Crazy he pulled that up to 2nd
"Lando, Leclerc and Max. Possible future legends"
As weird as it sounds a good strategy from Ferrari and good driving

"Oh how I hate F1TV. If I recall correctly, my Disney+ account came with ESPN+. Crossing my fingers that this works. I just want some method to watch these races. F1 shouldn't be having these problems still. Disappointed."
I would totally pay for it if I didn't see so many of these comments. Sad that illegal and dodgy streams seem to work better
"Hey, Saudi Arabia is the least bigoted country in the world. They even gave a robot modelled after a woman citizenship! 👉🏽👉🏽"
Twitch would go nuts
Simon Pagenaud is on his way over on a plane and has bribed Latifi to pull in and give him his car with 5 to go
"3 Disconnects & restarts for me, in the first 10 minutes :D"
"For real, fucking useless I hope we get a refund."
Good consistency. And Ferrari is battling McLaren!
I'm wondering if Mattia Binotto wanted to go elsewhere and Ferrari offered him a promotion instead.
I don't think they can do that on broadcast television
Just need 2 more DNFS. WE CAN DO IT
Chad latifi strat
I think they said 7th retirement of the race. As in he’s the 7th driver to retire today
Monaco 1996 would like a word.
Let's go for 8 next week!
I think he meant overall in this race
90s flashbacks
He was sick throughout. Really disappointed
"It’s almost better he was at the back when the trouble happened. Imagine if he had overtaken both Mercs just to retire from the lead... would have been even more heartbreaking. Of course, maybe the car wouldn’t have failed without the shunt, we don’t know."
"Not only did we get a podium, but it was young Lando!"
"Same, wtf??"
"Yep, had the same problem with the Pre-Race show. FOM need to fix their infrastructure."
Mine keeps saying “there is currently an issue with this content”.
"Yeah same here. I'm happy I didn't pay for it (got it through TV cable provider), because F1tv site is really putting out so many errors (error code 4.32.0 / 4.32.30) right now."
"You're not alone. I did too, only because yesterday I was suckered into Hulu, ESPN Disney package that doesn't cover all live ESPN. I have wasted a lot of money trying to watch this and I'm angry."
"Yeah. Piece of shit ""service"""
Its currently shitting the bed for everyone.
"yes, just a blank white screen. This blows."
mine is as dead as Ferrari's title hopes as well.
"It’s dead, find a Pirate stream."
Same dude I just thought like fuck it i'll get F1 tv half an hour ago and it's not even fucking working. I can not find a working stream anywhere else. fuck this.
please share the link of your pirated streams.
We still need Ricciardo to break down for F1 to be fully back.
"> Fucking monkeys paw

What?"
That paw.... RIC asked it to be fighting with the Ferraris - and got his wish :)
Same shit different racesuit
Imagine saying this about McLaren 3 years ago lol
Could not agree more
inb4 'Its BWOKEN' part 2 riccardo boogaloo
"Made by FOM, not Sky"
Sky made unqiue graphics? Thought the whole world used the F1 ones.
"That's not a Sky thing, that's an F1TV thing."
I still think the Halo looks hideous and snoozing since it covers so much of the screen but FOM has made the best of it

Mercs take  each other out and Albon slips by for the win? Subscribe.
James is full of shit
"no investigation necessary, apparently"
Other cars?? You mean you don’t want to watch two mercs limp around the circuit over and over?
Why would they need it lol? To clear vegetation for a wider vista?
"Entertained yes, but also dissappointed"
Thats not very usual I must say
What if the exact thing happen lap for lap next week ?!
Chad Albon vs virgin Perez
"Agreed, I hope Hamilton apologizes to Alex like he did in Brasil. He's robbed Alex twice now"
"Yeah, such a long gap they tried to fake us out with reruns smh."
They were sandbagging until the very end!
"This was an insane race. I don't want to say ""don't get used to it"", but that is probably a top 2 race this year"
the commentators didn't either! were talking about overtaking strats like there was 1 more lap to go
"Lando getting 3rd is cool, but Leclerc making it to 2nd is nothing short of a fucking miracle."
Landooooooooooo ayyyyyyy
Think giving him the slip stream was quicker and that’s what he was told
Was he asked to though?
"I'm not, it sucks"
Vettel has never been good at overtaking. His specialty was always running away from the front.
He’s over a second behind lol
The SF1000 dies not have any pace. At all.
I'm sincerely hoping that's because of damage
"Yes, app and webbrowser on pc"
Yeah
Same.....
Same :/
same
Same. :-( I've gotten a different error code or a white screen each time I've tried to load it.
I think he missed Albon altogether itself. Oh how I've missed Crofty
What am I paying for?! 🤬
I think the season is over... I'm turning off the TV
Do you have a link? Trying to watch on f1tv and getting nothing..
If his engine holds
Karma. Should've kneeled.
Can see the drive to survive advert segment  of him telling now
I know I am already
Have you ever heard the tale of Darth Ferrari the wise
especially 1/3 through the race
I heard that burble on the downshift into a corner and thought the same!
If/when he gets the Mercedes seat it's going to be scary
I cannot wait for him to get into a decent car.
At no point has Russel fell back from whoever was ahead of him at the time. Looking very positive for them.
Oh no!
He's given up
2020 happened
I'd like to see Vettel's chase on Russell.
"Yeah, vettel seems stuck behind russel?"
Please go brr brr brr break.
"Can't blame the driver if it's the team's shortcomings.

Can't blame the team if it's the driver's shortcomings."
Awwww yissss
I’ll take your entire stock
At this rate if you finish you will likely get points
Imagine Russel gets outscored 2 years running.
What do you mean 'The front fell of?!'
Chance in a million!
They're going to tow Kimi's car outside of the environment
Is he? Or is everyone falling away in front of him?
Not really. Just not retiring. Like most of the surviving drivers.
we took the tyre outside the environment
Tortoise and the hare. Except he's a super rich tortoise. Stroll 2.0
Please no...
ZAS DEEMED ILLEGAL BY FIA

Imma start doing the rain dance every day until next Sunday!
"His tyres are newer, I don't think Perez pitted did he?  He was holding a lead on him when they were both on softs, so here's hoping!!"
He does have fresh new tyres compared to Perez. It's definitely possible.
"Risky, but good clean overtake."
"With 9 retirements, lets calm down a bit"
Cue the 9 car montage of DNFs haha
I’m not sure if there will be 10 cars left by the end!
Itll probably be like the 2015 mclaren.
"I don’t want to criticize them because no commercials, but yeah.

It is what it is."
Gotta get back to SpOrTcEnTeR
Have to recoup that sponsor money from not showing commercials!
For real
This made me laugh far too much.
"100% agree, a huge fuss about nothing I liked it a lot."
Appreciated that the guys who didn't kneel weren't chastised for it either. They were still in solidarity which is most important
"I think people who will object with it will object regardless.

But I completely agree, it was a great demonstration of solidarity. I'm in awe, and feeling quite emotional about it."
so understated I missed it lol
"Yeah, definitely. And some doofuses on here want to be dicks about it."
Yes problems here too!
Not working
Having trouble here also. Don’t know why I keep paying for it.
Cleared site data / cookies and restarted chrome. Might be coincidal but works now.
"I am, won't load, it's pissing me off."
I do. Kinda disgusting paying 37.5 euros for something  that doesn't work.
"It’s actually disgusting how far ahead he is, especially when he makes a mistake and loses time he gains back half a second next corner"
Pretty much.
third time lucky
2029 is my guess for when the domination ends.
At least Liverpool won PL this year
Mercedes engineers handed it to themselves
unless.. 😳
LMAO! I actually quite enjoy it though.
Hahaha maybe it's cos whatever upgrade they had last year which made the FIA question their engine had been removed this year.
Because it is
There was nothing “hot” about those takes
Hot takes that have been correct for 6 years in a row aren’t really that hot anymore
loud kerbs drowning it out
Everybody likes that
And Russel in the poins first time!!
It’s got to have been 10 laps of only Mercedes ok screen. Unbelievably awful directing.
"At least they aren’t showing the audience like usual. 

Silver linings."
They are also coasting. No movement there either.
Geooooorge !
What can they even see from there?
Tractors are perfect for such terrain
It's such a sexy car.
Excellent watch
Is it supposed to do that ?
Cars can just avoid them. Drivers are becoming to liberal with driving in on the curbs and paying the price
"It depends when the SC was actually deployed, it's possible it came up on the steering wheel before or during the corner and Albon only noticed it after. Albon and Horner will be on the radio to ask for the position if they feel they were ahead, it's entirely possible they felt they weren't and gave that back."
He was getting anti-stall and being jerked around.
I think he was hitting the gas pedal really hard trying to bump start the car with the clutch.
Best race of the season so far
#2 0 2 0
I know. Utter joke. Robbing us of the rest of the race. Stupid
No
Binged all of the last season: no.
Same man. Fucking love it
You picked a damn good race that’s for sure
"Almost half of the grind being out isn't as common nowadays, you're lucky in terms of drama."
Miraculous
That Ferrari actually looked pretty good on harder tyres.
"I have to give it to charles here, well done"
Nothing compared to gasly
"At this point, Jenson actually just needs to legally change his name to yenson. It's the moral and right thing to do."
LANDOOOOOOOOO
Biff got to be president..
"Jesus, let it go, at least we got to even race."
"Someone catches the Rona, season is cancelled. Bottas becomes WDC."
Getting caught by RP tho
I was thinking the same thing. It sounds like it’s struggling
Its gearshifting has sounded sorta crunchy(?) to me since Barcelona.
I think it's the camera
More like 2.7 seconds and then it was obvious Bottas was clear.
Correct
Ferrari at the best
Seems like it...
"Was it ever not? It was a dumb fucking move from the minute he announced it. 

Of course no one is allowed to criticize Danny here...."
I like your optimism.
Ferrari has had to change their cheating methodology /s
china was perfection
It's just a double stack it's not that big a deal given the circumstances in this particular situation..
Isn't that one of his strengths?
Kevin's a top bloke. Deserved better than this.
"GTA SA: Aw shit, here we go again"
You are a spinny one
So typically 2020
Please!
"Well 12th either now, might win the attrition race though?!"
They're definitely going to have a field day with this one
I was excited for some fresh memes but they’re ending up to be the same every year
"""Some will use that to say they made the right decision."" Yikes."
"Also, no fan reaction shot yet :D"
It is fantastic. Would love a McLaren revival.
08 or 18
I’d probably cry tears of happiness.
At least 7 minutes of fhis
There are other cars?!
I saw some in the far distance like 10 laps ago....
There aren't really any cars closer together other than Kyvat/Ocon and this is the drama for the lead....
"Dont jinx it bro!
But whilst we are at it. The gearboxes in the two black, and the one remaining pink Mercs will explode and then Albon will win!"
Except Latifi.
Please
"I don’t understand, why did Mercedes not pit?"
he's out for blood LETS GO I WANT TO SEE CHAOS
Forklift and everything!
"Cars falling apart left right and center, but apart from Lewis, has anyone overtaken on track?"
The Nascar method
And that's just for finishing the race
Don’t you get my hopes up
Ferrari master plan
SC signs were up
Perez didn't slow down when saftey car came out so he managed to barley get the place back
He didn’t. He braked harder than he needed to and lost it.
"He shouldn't, Perez just break after him"
Likely because it happened _just_ after the SC was called
It looks like the flags were waved slightly before/during his overtake of Perez. Meaning it would be an illegal overtake.
He didn’t lol Perez breaked late
Overtake during (V)SC
The cars are social distancing from their parts
Not over yet.
Well for the starters the wheel is not supposed to fall off.
"There's some tracks that seem to have more drama than others and more ""bad luck"" which results in lots of WTFuckery while others are just a total snooze fest."
Definitely not normal
Normal would be 1-2 retirements
"Not at all, its a punishing circuit with the kerbs, first race of the season and a long off season means everyones a bit rusty, but this is abnormal. Not unheard of though, just unusual."
This is way more retirements than we normally see in a race
Some retirement is expected but this is unusual
"Not for many years. And back when every race had this many retirements, like in the 80s, they didn't use safety cars."
"If the Mercs retire, I’ll be happy"
I would love that so much. Please.
We can dream
TIRE! TIIIIIRE!!!!
Lewis will probably say he didn't have anywhere to be faster since Bottas was ahead of him...
I thought we did have Lando coverage final lap!
"Same here, I've been waiting months for this."
Stay off the cuuuuuuuurrrrrrbs
"I had him in my fantasy with Albon, only if the collision didn’t happen"
Slowest car on straight
He did.
Kinda sad Checo was so close
"They give us commercial free racing every race day, I’m not complaining. Thank you Mothers!"
"Probably a sky thing. I'm guessing espn has the rights to simulcast pre-race and the race, not the post-race"
"9 dnfs, and it wasn't even a wet race!"
I screamed when Hamilton fucked Albon.
"Truly a shame for Perez, that car is not worth his talent. Vettel definitely had a pretty bad race. Quite a lot of retirements today."
"Why did they not pit him for softs under the safety cars?? Feels like it was a strategy mistake, he lost his pace towards and end and kept dropping back. The penalty is what it is, but if he was on softs maybe he'd have finished where lando did."
:DDD
Lmao i love these memes
"Yep, can't open it on any device."
I managed to open it on android. Hope it gets fixed before the race
Why?
Always fucking issues with Ricciardo. So frustrating to watch
The covid neck warmer.
Hes on softs so i expect the SC to be good for him.
Vettel to Williams 2021?
he have to go to check his spines are alright after carrying that shitbox to victory
same here
I was having trouble too. Switched to ESPN (US)
I'm having trouble as well.
"Nope, they shat the bed literally the first race of the season. I always send them 'threatening emails' stating that I am 100% ok with dropping them like a stone and 'stealing' the content in the form of illegal streams in these situations. I almost always get a months refund in those cases.

It's weird though because last year there were few issues that I can remember.  


EDIT: lol at the *immediate* downvote. I WANT to pay F1 to watch their shit, they just shit the bed far too often for them to not give me money back for my subscription. I pay them to watch races live. They have had so many instances of the website shitting the bed right before a race it was borderline not worth the money up until last season"
Yeah I want to support official streaming but this is bullshit.
That actually crashed the page for me lol (error 4.32.0 again).
"I mean, if I was gonna buy a Mercedes road car, it would feel right to get it in black too"
its that BBC MERC COMING SOON BABY
1st race of the season? No team orders here
*subscribe*
Slow and steady gets the points.
when ferrari fucks up qualy they normally do ok like italy 2019
Bold of you to assume they’re not gonna fuck it up somehow
Is the merc engine on RP last years spec? Or did they supply them with new ones
"Norris is catching, slowly but surely."
"But six feet apart, of course."
They often don't give anything if there is a wider lane and plenty of space for two cars. We'll see.
Perfect description. Almost def from that sound with headphones on
Perfect description. Almost deaf from that sound with headphones on.
"Toto controls Ocon...

Mind blown 0_o"
It does
I think they've all spent their time off studying memes.
haha good one
They didn’t pit him - it’ll be a matter of time before he has to pit for the first time.
"I think they added one, you can see it in the trailer"
"Yeah, very neat"
Sounds like when it sucks something up lmao
"Not working on F1.tv. RmThey had to disable the onboards just to show the race. Another year, another inept F1.tv."
Mercedes are in F0. Everybody down the Haas and Williams are F1. Haas and Williams are F1.5
Lets wait before it breaks down..
There’s 20+ laps to go. What’s the point?
But they are? 😂
Great isn't it? Only two cars are competitive and they're being told every lap to go slower.
basically every straight is a DRS zone
It's a super long straight at the beginning of each lap
Yeah Martin was saying earlier how it's dumb that this track has 3 DRS zones.
He was missing his buddy
Occon is about the same gap to Kvyat staying between .7 and 1 second back. The rest is pretty spread out. Vettel is the only one car out of position that should be moving up.
Actually nothing is happening really
"it's barely even a fight, it's just those two cruising a million miles in front of everyone lmao it's quite boring"
Dude can't overtake a Williams to save his life
Is anything happening in the midfield? I don't know. I know that at the from Merc drama is interesting.
"5 mins till a ""listen here you little shits..."" On the radio"
Better than the front falling off
"I lol'ed  


HAHAHAHAHAHA"
Still mercedes 1-2
well there hasnt been any race in quite some time too
Really? I'd prefer racing.
"That's not very typical, I'd like to make that point"
"You made my day, thank you"
It would be funny ngl
The devs really need to tone down the RNG though.
It's been a thing for years are you a new fan?
This could be all of dts 3 and I'd be happy
"Imagine one of the writer in Netflix complained that ""we dont have enough material for this season""  


And the first race is just like this"
True :(
Well when seven cars drop out lol—he just got third as I’m writing this—and Lewis got a +5 so Leclerc is second
Since Canada last year stewards have been more lenient.
"Exactly, if Perez had steered into Leclerc, everyone would have blamed Lectlec for the accident"
"Be bold and you'll win the penalty. Perez gave up, so it's Charles' position to take"
Well that's when the standard was set right? It was established after Max's move that this was the way that they race. At least it's not a double standard.
"I disagree, Max didn't leave any room last year, he literally pushed him off the track"
On one there was contact and was left no space and in the other has been no contact and there was space
Curbs?
Albon
His foot was probably still on full throttle hahahaha
I think they'll all be wrapping the sensors with bubble wrap.
"> Ferrari

When did he say that?"
A banana and disconnected bot
Maybe both?
This was pure luck. I do agree that they were more reliable.
DOTD
Everyone knows the real race is to see who finishes 3rd
Just you wait until Latifi slices his way through the field.
Not gonna lie this comment sucks so if you downvote it I totally understand
Absolutely. This is ridiculous
I think Albon could be the next Hamilton
Albon f’ed up. Simple as that. Driver error and Hamilton gets the blame. Crazy.
He's on medium tho
It was German for Multi 21
"No, take the foil of your head."
"Nah it was round the other side of the circuit that Kimi crashed, whole half lap to call safety car"
"The guy is so terrible at commentary, just talks for the sake of talking. 

Honestly can hear Martin's frustration with Crofty's hot takes."
And hopefully radio for the whole last lap?
Im sure it will be available soon somewhere
I have a transcript: *E A R R A P E*
And Russell in the points!
"yes, have been for quite some time, ... special stunt helicopter"
"Because everyone is on it, and their systems probably crash on the huge traffic load"
Hugged to death.
It's such a fucking joke those assholes can't even run a streaming service. I'm either being kicked off or told to pick a subscription plan. They need to postpone the race until they've got their shit figured out
They didn't even respond to the last ticket I sent them last season. Bunch of twats
https://sportsurge.net/#/streamlist/1144
Absolutely gutted I've missed the start already
DRS?
He is just that efficient!
They disabled the cheat code
rumours of a brand new engine?
Karma!
His armors gonna be nicely trimmed tho
Bruh
engine so bad it doesn't create enough power to break
All thanks to the great Ferrari Master Engine
And mine things were going too well
They’re both going to get in the points at this rate
Reliability is the one thing Williams gets right.
"Yeah for all people rag on Williams for being slow, they do seem to be among the more reliable cars"
Finishing every race in last place is still worse than finishing 50% of races in the top 10 though
They're calling the Merc strat from last year lmao
Only the McLarens are left so the camera shows the empty stands.
"I mean right now only Ferrari haven't had an engine failure so that's an odd take.

Ferrari powered by turtles, last man standing race."
Sainz still hasn't been seen. Some things never change.
Themselves lol
absolute circus down at the rari
It's screaming for help.
"Find another sport, daddy"
"No it doesn't, Bottas sucks at the end of stints, every track like this Bottas pits early and either two stops or has horrible pace end of the final stint which is exactly what happened last year here. Hamilton instead of going long and having 15-20 lap younger tires end of race had to pit same time. This helps Bottas significantly but I still don't rate his chances."
The gap was destroyed before the SC tbh
Brundle today seems a bit off
"Lewis Hamilton is never late, Wsbelitemem. Nor is he early; he arrives precisely when he means to."
Me too mate
"Sainz slowed down a little too much after being cut off by Leclerc, Vettel was already locked up."
Desperate times call for desperate moves
If he didn't lock up it would have been fine
So leclerc world champion?
Where did they say that? Powering down =/= don't overtake. It's still equal if they both have powered down engines. Stop putting words into their mouth
Sounds like an over reved lawn mower.
In what way?
Sharl Eclair
Charles Eclerc
Hummmmmmmmmmm
not so fast!
That enables nitros
multi 21?
It's mercs multi 21 obviously. It's such a bs sequence of words.
"We don't really know that since Max retired. 

He's traditionally strong here and would have certainly pounced on this Mercedes issue.
If not taking the places on track, but forcing a retirement."
"And Haas again, you'd think after 4 seasons they'd figure out how to make brakes work."
He has much more potential than his car.  He’ll be wasted this season
What a setup.
Nah not anymore. Its called weightsaving.
"Yeah, they are usually attached to the car. Helps with driving."
They usually have a tether?
sweet
Albon gave it back
He didn’t really push. He just didn’t slow down as fast. I’m sure they’ll have a look at it
I am tyred of your puns!
Shut up and take my upvote.
The dream for this weekend
"Albon passed Perez, but right at time the SC signs went up, so Albon gave the position back to Perez. Perez did nothing wrong."
For recent times I think so..
You mean crash into Hamilton in the 68th lap?
Dream becoming a reality
And this is why minorities can't get ahead.
I agree.
Hamilton did exactly the same as Albon did. I dont know how you cant remember that.
He was clearly slow enough to turn in harder and decided not to... And Alben was in front.
"he sure did, but thats legal I would say. Albon should have just been more wary of that."
Video?
*chef kiss* ahh yes as we all thought it would go
"they've been sandbagging, the point for fastest lap is the new Formula 1 championship to pay attention to"
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yeah or can be taken during a pitstop
Correct
Yes!
Wow...this is quite an active subreddit  Thanks again!
HOOK IT TO MY VEINS
Plus Leclerc +5 seconds behind Hamilton
Jinxed it mate
'Cause a few more laps and we'd have had no car left!
Imagine that McLaren with Merc Power next year.
Fucking insane lap he did
Literally last lap
it would have been far more heart breaking to see Albon pass both Mercs only to have his car shit on him at the end there
ABSOLUTE POGGERS
Netflix covering mclaren this week .. hell yeah
"Tbf almost half of the drivers didn’t finish, and Lewis"
Yep. This was a 2016/2017 Max type mistake.
But his engine would have still gone Kaput?
Not in the US! Haha
That was Ocon :)
It was Ocon
"I missed it, who kneeled?"
Yeah barely touched sainz and was already spinning.
"All the people who claim it is boring have allegedly turned off the telly. Weirdly, some of those who claimed to have tuned out are still commenting..."
"The race is boring, from the VER retirement we knew how it would end. The drive is funny as all cars but the Mercs are unreliable."
"yeah, things in the race have changed if you hadn't noticed."
"*Formula 1*, you are a strange beast"
Holy shit
I know :(
"Yes, as usual."
Yes
Yes :( Page wont load properly
Yes
that'd be quite a _spin_
"it was literally fractions of a second between the overtake and the safety car sign, idk if it was intentional.."
"Yeah, not right"
"Just like alonso, Leclerc is fucking carrying the team"
2 times in 3 races. I honestly couldn't believe what I was seeing when it happened. I feel so bad for Albon.
Same....
"Not working for me neither on Argentina... There are some other... places where you can watch the pre-race but F1 website has nothing, I get a 404 on the pre race show."
sent you a PM.
Doesn't work for me
I'm having problems as well.
"Its working on my android phone, but not in chrome on my pc."
"Not working for me, in the u.s."
It's like we never had a break!
Maybe not if the issue is a gearbox as it could happen to Albon
Unless his car breaks down...
TV director: Haha nice yoke
just need Ham at 1
or Albon?
"Doubt it, McLaren dont have the pace."
organized my weekend around this as well :(
"Same here... still watching for danny... oh no

Go Lando!"
The winner of the race is going to be whoever uses those pedals to complete 71 laps first.
Cars should’ve been wearing masks
The Ferrari Master Plan ^TM
Le Mans may be more competitive as the FIA has nerfed Toyota.
Ah that's what it was. It looked very strange.
It’s just ridiculous
Hamilton has had loads of bad luck during his career believe it or not.
"Assuming he started on softs it's a mistake, they aren't fast enough to be worthwhile and he'll have to eek them out too far for it to matter if they are a bit faster earlier. The hard tires were king here last year and almost certainly will be this year."
"Betting he can take Lando and then run away in clean air long enough to clear a second stop (or not stop at all - they did 28 on softs, 41 on mediummight be doable)."
"I think he’s the only one on that strategy. Banking on that track temp to degrade the tires and a two stopper being the faster play, I guess."
did he use his hards in FP?
Yeah lol looks dead
Say the line Bart!
Now it feels like F1 is back!
BoTtAs 3.0 fUtUrE wOrLd ChAmPiOn
Ricciardo DNF. CHECK
Yeah it's like how I play racing on xbox
Nah fuck that we want 10th
Even better if a couple more cars ahead retire. Would be great for him to get points this race
4 slowish laps and 1 fast lap is less fast overall than 5 medium speed laps
He's just shite
Subscribe
"Albon, Perrez, Norris podium."
With some juicy leclerc ham please
A McLaren Éclair...so to speak.
"So...

A Renault engine then? :P"
sounded like a chainsaw
Can it take the pounding that is to come? Find out next time on Formula 1 Z!
I feel bad for him lol
"Was just thinking thay. Would be beautiful. 

Would also get Kimi back to the points where he would be if it wasnt for that saftey car."
"or not, race over"
Probably Romulans
Lewis def on more too
Albon?
Albon-Perez-Norris podium is certainly something I would take
Mercedes with a voodoo doll.
I reckon this is their last season
Happened last year with Kubica
Thank fuck there's no crowd!
That is not very typical I'd like to make that point.
Nope
The front is not supposed to fall off for a start.
I felt this.
It doesn’t normally do that
Don't worry. They tow it outside the environment.
I'd like to make the point that it is not normal.
I'm not saying that the car was unsafe just perhaps not as safe as other cars.
That’s what I was thinking. I thought there were safety measures built into the tire systems to ensure that exact thing didn’t happen.
I don't think Alfa can do anything about it if the tire pops out from wheel
And one of them will be Ferrari.So disappointed
And VET is still out of the points.
Reminds me that I have some curry in the fridge!
What did he say?
What did he say?
aaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Albon should’ve learned from Brazil. Patience
Tracing point*
5 seconds? In my race that'd be a drive through at a minimum.
throw some darts at a board and you'll probably have a better chance at being right
We couldn’t have asked for a more fitting race for 2020
pity vote
Maybe Leclerc is like Fernando and can drag a lacking red car up the order??
Yeah but they basically took the elevator today and I’m a Ferrari fan.
Only midfield team I see is Ferrari :)
I got a feeling McLaren is not midfield anymore.
Classic FOM director.
Too much Simracing from the drivers?
Looked like an online race right around dinner time.
"""Everything went exactly as we planned."""
XD
He just won grid bingo.
Terrible move by Seb. Yuck.
Albon will catch the mercs who are on 20+ lap hards lol
It's almost as if warning someone to avoid a problem leads to the problem being avoided.
Keeps the cameras focused on them so that their sponsors are happy
That's the sign of a good team. Always have 5% to spare
5D chess move right here.
"This is actually very obviously true, funny how nobody sees it."
I think you'd have a better chance of making a point if you could spell. Lewis isn't a tricky word to get right.
That's how bad he is.
"Really well put, it's so good to see F1 supporting this and great to see the sky coverage saying that this is a movement that should last more than a news cycle"
Can this year get any worse?
Ferrari are a solid midfield team
passing broken Racing point
And Haas... Don't forget Haas.
"Different year, same shit."
Dunno... Russell is in 12th!
[deleted]
They don't have much of a choice. He's basically keeping them alive right now with his sponsors.
"Considering all their sponsors are from Latifi, they might not have had a choice"
"Well, the reasons for hiring him haven’t changed, he brings plenty of money."
"I'm willing to give him a couple races here, but yeah not the greatest start"
Thats was awful hahah
At least they didn't show it during a battle
Lewis.
What’s wrong with drinking milk? 😭
From what we’ve seen this is a decent prognostication
Nope!
nope
"Only on my android phone, and then barely.

Firefox, chrome and edge all don't work on pc."
No just a white page
It's working now for me
"Logs me out, says i'm signed in on another device."
Luckely that supports chrome cast.. Oh no
"Of course not, why would anyone expect huge website traffic at the first race back?"
not for me
"Not really :( Kinda ridiculous that this service isn't exactly new, but they still aren't ready to be stable for the opening race."
"yeah, no go here."
"I have had access all weekend, though Friday was rough while F1 was on (F2/3 and Supercup were fine). Now when I refresh the home page nothing at all loads, just a blank white screen."
Having issues too.
Same. The website is having all kinds of problems for me right now.
I fucking cannot subscribe. They won't take my money.
At least it's working for you.
Honestly all the people saying that Bottas is running away are not paying attention.
Scratch that
"Same, had to go with a stream"
i know right. so many people here bitching that Bottas already won lmao.
Vettel going to nab that last point
Finally Ferrari fighting Mclaren again. Like in the good old times.
[deleted]
sport surge
"Yes!! Took the time to pay for it and ended up on an illegal Sky Sports stream. Mine is at f1livegp.me, it works just fine."
"Or go Battle Royale style where DRS shifts during the race

Or Death Race style where you have to hit a certain button on the track (or painted section on the track) to enable it"
He will switch to iRacing because it's more realistic
F
are we horrible people hoping for this lmaoo?
Easy solution: Hamilton DNF
I am rooting for Alex so much right now
My first thought was... hey maybe Lando has a place on the Podium after all!  Still bummed for Max though.
What a shit engine this year
Binotto comes in and Ferrari slide down the grid like the banana splits and seb gets sacked...
Tyres?
"Stares at Alex's 23, pls no"
Guess its easier to have good reliability when you have no power..
loosing 1 sec in one year looks a technical issue to me
"> If Lewis can take two tents out of valtteri each lap

And a sore bum."
He's wearing his tires more so Bottas still might have the advantage
Yet.
For now
It gave up in practice.
How about that 11 seconds for Albon and the mercs ...
They'll start putting masks on the exhaust.
Race isn't over yet.
"To finish first, first you have to finish"
I'm still in shock...
"""Hey guys, we can drive all 22 races this season with just one engine! ...guys?"""
"They shifted the tab from illegal to legal

Anything else is a bonus"
Doubt it or there would be more cars on mediums.
Its perez so there a decent chance
AMG engines always sound gruff as hell. Nice deep grumble.
"It's a Mercedes GT R,  but agreed, the sound is lit"
On hards. Yay
Now he needs to say BONO ME TIRES ARE GONE and we have a bingo
The new energy drink?
ya sounded really weird
Looks like it’s only got 7 gears
Now if only they could put an 0.5 second delay on it to synchronise is with the sound that would be perfect.
I am still in the midfield camp
It's tough supporting Vettel these days
not just you!
Sounds like a paper shredder
"With the way things are going today, it just might."
You guys have plans?
Surely not on the first race?
Full time team principle part time model
In before Toto shows up at the next race with a Fig Newtons sticker on his visor
Let them risk it!
I'd love a super cut of 2 secs ted
New F1 fan and watched the last 3 Austrian GP's this week. It is hilarious every single time.
There's no fight rn
Only when they want to show leclerc
He’s trying to cancel his Ferrari contract
Wish they'd show the Rai/Rus/Vet fight
"Lol it's true, I'd like to see the onboard"
Ferrari is a shitbox
"I mean, Vettel had contact..."
😂
Latifi was looking absolutely horrible. So far behind Russell.
They are a bunch of vankers so far
😅
And he does not deserve it a bit!
"Sure. He was already past him, imho."
Faster than latifi *this race*
Albon*
Alvin :P
It's all part of the Ferrari master plan
Figure it can be difficult to control where the car stops on only 3 wheels
"Don't know how easy the car would have been to recover form there, but in general you would not want to leave a car to run-off area."
"Are you talking before or after the wheel comes off? Heading into a right turn going 200+I'm/h and your wheel comes off , yeah your gonna want to take the gravel run off opposed to cutting across the track with traffic behind you but I assume your talking after the traffic , it's closer to the truck and the pits"
I'll give Ted a nut
"Germany was incredible last year, but they had the excuse of rain."
You cannot lose if you are the only one on track lol
Is that the safety car driver ? 😂
Hopefully ham gets a penalty for hitting albon.
It was a worthy sacrifice.
Someone said 3 different teams on the podium
Not used to this podium business yet
"Yes, opens towards the end of the race"
"I think a pile of votes were given when it looked like Albon could take the win, and then tapered off once the incident happened."
pls race at spielberg every week if all the races are like this
Given the supposed sensor issues I'd say Merc was driving more conservatively than normal.
He helped his luck a great deal.
10 second time penalty.
You got any more of that F1 stuff? *crack head meme*
"Same layout, same everything. Just a different name."
As is.
Latiffi will finish 4th because he'll be too far back to get caught up in the mayhem
Amazing. McLaren 1 2.
Thanks for the reminder that Ocon is back! Lol totally forgot about him with all the shenanigans leading up to this season
Welcome to F1.
Maybe they're defending the driver. Nothing HE could've done.
Maybe they're defending the driver. Nothing HE could've done.
they argue he didnt go onto the ''fast'' lane. I dont know what the rules are exactly but it looked pretty clearly unsafe to me

"Honestly, that was terrible pit team management there. So dangerous."
"because its not, its not black and white, noticed he didn't disturb Norris, he didn't get into fast lane either, its fair fight"
"Right as Sainz was about to attack Leclerc as well, first I was about to laugh about one thing, then the other one happened."
Nah everyone going into the unknown for reliability plus one Merc engine has already retired due to engine issues.
Albon - Am I joke to you??
bono what is curb
Where the podium at doe
Definitely. Give Hamilton the clean air to make up some of that time.
"Yeah, and give Lewis a free victory? No."
"And what about Ferrari?  
  
Will Ferrari strats screw them again?"
I love how Ferrari engine cars are not even mentioned due to their irrelevance.
"Danny has had some terrible luck the last couple of seasons. Hope McLaren give him a fast, reliable car next year."
For me yes. He was alongside him and Hamilton pushed him out of track.
"So stoked F1 is back, it's been a yeet of a race"
Same. Even a procession would’ve been fine but to have a spicy race makes it even better. I’ve missed this!
Australia 2002 enters the chat
Without a fucking doubt
seemed like race incident where hamilton luckied out
"If it was Vettel doing his race, would be countless posts calling him a God. Because it was Vettels rival, it will be scrubbed off"
IT LOOKS LIKE RACING IS BACK ON THE MENU BOIS
And girls
All they have to do is make sure the first race isn’t in Australia
Verstappen out
Just need Hamilton victory and Kvyat torpedo now
"Latifi didn't get to pit when Russell did, they left him for dead. He's within 0.1 seconds of Russell in terms of pace and is faster than the Haas cars."
He apologised the first time in Brazil.
*Happy noises*.
Me too. What a morning.
"I kind of want to see at least one of them out of the points, not through a DNF but an actual pointless finish, just to see the shitshow afterwards."
This is ridiculous considering all the problems there were last year and all the months they had to fix and be ready for 2020.
Shit is down. Piece of shit service.
Not only you. It's down
"Ehh max had to defend on a harder compound, people are missing that fact, it’s stable now."
"Most people here? Probably piracy.


Google sports surge for links :)"
I fucking swear I'm not renewing this year. POS
Dropping behind the Hamilton and Albon was to be expected. Of Landon can hold position and Carlos can gain one or two places that will be an awesome result for them:)
"I hate to admit it, but there is something about black race cars.  I blame Dale Sr."
Hello Christian.
Especially now that Verstappen retired. Bummer for Red Bull
Agreed
It was over yesterday
They should focus on next year's car
"It's me, f1 fans."
More like Bottas being in his own dimension. Albon is not that far from Hamilton for now
Don’t you find the possibly of a fight between Bottas and lewis intreasting?
Nah seems electrical
how many engines do they have for this shortened season?
I feel like it was hydraulic. I think i heard Verstappen say something about no having any brakes.
I think there's still a good race for 3rd. Albon's not good enough to run away with it.
"Might not need to if Bottas has an ""issue"" during his pitstop."
"WHY IS IT ALWAYS HIM?

Hopefully McLaren can turn a new leaf for Ric. Although that's what we were all hoping for with Renault :("
"Everyone except one team, you know it."
brb writing fanfic real quick
Now that would be something.
Feels like F1 is back now!
"Pls, not like this"
Might be managing it till like 3-4 second gap
truly..
"Once upon a time the guy was getting podiums, but he's been a joke for so long now"
Its like playing easy on f1 2019.
Would be nice if both of the merc got those issues as well
"Even if he does, people will probably still blame some Mercedes team order conspiracy or some shit despite his performance today"
surely not
Looked like it.
Sounds like RP dumped some gravel in it on the start line.
Probably
"It’s Perez, you could put no tyres on his car and he would get the car to the end"
Lewis had it down to about 3+
"Ham was catching at 5 tenths a second, safety car probs helped bottas"
It was great to listen to that.
They have access to everybodys onboard cameras. Footage they talked about was 360 camera footage which only few cameras are live broadcasted.
first 3 episodes won't have any racing in then LOL
"Because their engineers are vankers, obviously"
"they are clueless, they have no expertise and don't want to pay for it"
If Ferrari get on the podium I'll eat my hat
Bro the sky would have to split open and god would have to descend on the earth for that to happen.
No it's just some pick up rubber.
"What’s left? Hamilton tyres gone, Valtteri it’s james, Sainz and Leclerc crash,"
...and 2018
Normal Vettel move... sadly.
Pretty sure Latifi didn't manage to catch end of trail before restart.
That’s just 2020 ferrari power unit
"If anyone can make it last, it's Checco"
Observe
"We always say this, we are always proven wrong...these pirellis make absolutely no sense"
He already said he isn't really thinking about retirement that much and would very much like to stay in F1. He even hinted that he would love to be at Mercedes.
I think the car mics are fucked on multiple cars today.
It's the mic.
Changing up sounds horrendous
brbrbrbaaaaaaap brbrbrbraaaaaaaaaaap
They all do!
listen to a Renault car lol
"Idk, both Renault's sounded crap onvoard"
Latifi almost 20 seconds behind...
"Nah, 2014. Where the McLaren and force India were faster than ferrari"
The problem is that he has to be driving hard to not get passed by Sainz
OMG PLEASE
right? completely useless broadcasting that
"I mean, if everyone thinks you're the baddies anyway, might as well lean into it."
Well 4 of them are parked up in the garage.
Kerb
I think its the mic placement
"Nick Heidfeld actually commented on it awhile ago like ""I don't know if that's how it's supposed to sound."""
Trial version. Stops working after 3 races.
He was definitely riding them more than Lewis.
"Yup, but you'd think hes not and Lewis is taking all of them judging by the comments lol"
They both are it looks like
"Well, better than watching vettel Not able to pass Russel"
Yeah he’s in a Ferrari
His problem is his engine
Yeah he‘s in a Ferrari
He’s driving a shitbox
Ye. He's driving for Ferrari
You cursed it!
"Whole field wipes our, Williams wins for the memes"
"Well have you seen what happened to Verstappen, Riccciardo and Russell?"
Trying for the top speed bonus
Is Ferrari unreliable? I thought they were just slow.
An awesome way to start the season!
Let’s hope so
"Whilst I would be absolutely thrilled for Latifi, that would just be an injustice to George. Last year Kubica scored 1 point and George 0, even though George was the better driver. And now this..."
Especially during times like these. Def a rehearsal for the season.
"Not sure about that, last few years reliability was way better at the first race"
I think we’ve only had 3 or 4 retirements from reliability in Australia over the last two years and we’ve had 5 today and possibly more...this is way worse than the last few years
Let us dream!
Mercedes 1-2 with both cars in limp mode.
You mean Norris after Albon burns his softs out
He pitted.
Preparing him for Ferrari strategists
Latifi Gon have more points in one race than russels entire career
"I mean, you use it to steer, so..."
The wheel fell off
Wasnt suspension related
tether didnt fuck up. the tyre was never properly on. Massive penalty for Alfa incoming.
Note: the tyre died on the way to its home planet.
Imagine if latifi gets points before Russell!
"""I've got my gloves *and* steering wheel, but something's still missing?"""
y
"It looks like a Pirelli fault to me. Only the rubber came off, by the looks of it."
"First one maybe. Second one helps, right, as it shortens the race?"
Both have hurt McLaren tbh..
Russell in bits if Latifi gets points
The Lando and Albon memes would be too much
early noughties. i love it.
Oh that's what is says. I thought it was ranking racism in some fucked up table.
What else you gonna watch with safety car out.
Or finish 11th out of 11.
He is on soft and everyone in front is on medium/hard. So he may come back to the same spot he was before spin
Just did.
He overtook him under the SC and gave the position back to Perez
ALBON'S BEEN IN THIS PLACE BEFORE
"Strategy.


Lol"
"#LETS GOOOO LANDO


Edit: HE DID IT"
Might as well throw him a point just for surviving this
Demolition Derby would leave more cars alive
Ferrari really really needed that almost insurmountable recovery. Hopefully seb gets out of his own head.
Good one to start with haha!!!
Part 2 next weekend!
Ric will def get a podium or two in a Maclaren
Could have possibly been a redbull 1-2 if they didn’t have their reliability issues.
Fluke
I wouldn’t have it any other way :D
"From the physics side of things, Hamilton didn't really have time to react.

He was already at the maximum turning angle for the speed he was travelling at, and he was always going to drift wide.

I think the penalty is just, and my heart bleeds for Albon, but it was a matter of circumstances.

If Hamilton had expected Albon to be able to make such an impressive run around the outside, he would have carried more curb and less speed on the way in and kept a tighter line."
What did he say?
Dude what was that I mean for me is Hamilton fault again bro.
"What if it's not Merc that's so much better, everyone else is just shit"
"I mean Stroll just lost a place due to an engine issue but, kinda yeah."
Must come with that sweet sweet 💰 that Williams needs.
yeah but he's rich so
"He's never going to be great but rookies have always been significantly slower in their first races and first season. Standard is massive gain in the first 2-3 races, then steadier gains over another year or more. 

People forget this because we haven't had many more standard experience vs rookie partnerships. Leclerc against Ericsson, but Ericsson was slow as fuck vs a great rookie. Russell vs Kubica but Kubica hadn't been in a single seater race in what 8 years was it. 

Calling him shit because of performance in his very first race is a shitty thing to do."
I think theres enough cars left to chain safety cars for the win
Wait for it.
We riot As ONE
Just like in Brazil 2019...
The penalty in Brazil actually dropped Albon from 6th to 8th in the drivers standings. Not tremendously helpful in either case.
"Technically not, because he’s p12 now..."
He's 12th
Albon took himself out.
I mean latifi almost finished in points...
That feeling when their strategy actually paid off.
insane lucky
"Idk, he didn’t make a move towards the outside and there was still space ."
Can't give him a penalty though. God forbid.
second one. I won't forget this one either.
He did exactly the same as Albon did to him in the exact same corner..
"LIFT ME UP LIFT ME UP

HIGHER NOW RARAMBA"
"They slip down too easily, some are poor designs. Not a priority when you're celebrating I suppose"
"hey you can wear whatever you want however you want, not sure why you want to control what others do. You're not even there, this doesn't affect you in any way"
"Yesterday they broadcasted a music performance where they had drummers up on that bull statue in 40 meters high, as well as a violinist sitting on the side of a helicopter flying above it.

That was crazy as well."
Imagine if everyone else DNF due to engine issues and both Ferraris cross for a podium finish.i can already imagine Vettel driving with one hand on steering and holding a cigarette in another.
Alonso and Button during the McHonda days
See ya Vettel. Enjoy retirement bud.
"All this, with cars dropping out makes no sense for the team to risk the engines."
Dibber dobber lmao
Just a 2 year old stuck in a 30 something year olds body. Might be insulting to a 2 year old however.
It’s almost like they can’t see for themselves
Nothing's going on
why would they bluff the other teams cant hear the radios just yet
What a season opener that would be!
that would be awesome
Don't do that. Don't give me hope..
2-3 laps overdue
"It's punishment, not retribution. That's typical of an incident like that"
Twice now
Albon screwed Albon
Why would Bottas want to hand points to his main championship rival?
right place at the right time tbh
"He got my driver of the day vote, though I wish I'd waited until after Norris' last lap."
Could have won what? Without the SC the rest of the field isn't even a factor.
I give it one lap.
I won't be surprised if he's P2 by the end of the first sector.
Doubt it but hope so
F1tv app is shit. I’m going to start pirating now. Screw them
What browser/device are you using? Still nothing for me.
You got ESPN?
It latterly in the description of the thread
"It worked perfectly fine for FP and qualifying. Come race day, they manage to fuck it up. Unbelievable."
Gosh I just use it to augment the TV and let me watch 2 drivers POV and I'm pissed. I can't even imagine if that's the only way you have to watch
"To be fair, cutting to the crowd is often quite handy when it rains to judge how bad it is."
Quali was so good with almost all of the camera time being on laps.
Same. Tell me if it starts working for you
Yep. Thought it would be a great legal solution. It's completely missed the mark. $80 down the drain. Should have tried monthly.
"P1 end of Lap 1. 


Believe."
You won't be the only one
it's unacceptably bad.
he pulled a lewis
[deleted]
"Seriously. I paid them for the year in advance, then the season didn't start, which I could at least understand. Now it's completely non-functional on race day. 

Do you want people to pirate your races? Because this is how you get people to pirate your races."
there was something very endearing about him still living at home with his sisters.
He's the only driver who hasn't been portrayed as kind of an asshole in the whole show
Works for me
Wankers
if i’m not mistaken it will take a few races to decide which teams are in F1.5
Pretty much. They're not even best of the rest right now.
Are you having issues loading it also? I think we're overloading the server
"Pretty much every season is just people here asking why everyone else is so slow without thinking about how Mercedes is just really good. RBR and Ferrari try, they just aren’t as good."
Haha head rocking go brrrm
it just.started LMAO
Same I really was.
Yep was hoping to see him chase him down.
Yes !!!!
The upside down table leaders
Takes too long to change.
Loses him more time than what he wins
Only 6 more months of this buddy 😀
Did he say it on the radio? Poor guy. I feel for him.
Crofty sounds depressed too
[deleted]
I can't wait for Hamilton to complain about an issue that never does anything to slow him down.
It’s all part of the Ferrari Master Plan!
Yeah no surprise
"Yeah except for the evil empire, obviously"
If I see Sainz overtake a Ferrari I’ll splooge
I assume they provide one of their engineers to their customers. It's to be expected for that engineer to report back
They make their engine
"Same engine, so if somethings wrong with the racing point there may be something that goes wrong with his"
Mercedes understand their own cars very well.
Sounds like the gears are grinding it sounds awful
Gotta own it I guess
"Yeah, i was so thrilled for this race. Shame."
Saved the car tbf to him
Lol you know that’s not happening
I feel he will finish in points today.🤞🤞
Probably just rubber scraps
I am shocked I tell you.  Shocked!
He is dangerously slow.
SPINNOW
Sbinbastian
covid is now over
they never should have dropped Sirotkin smh
"Well he is behind a ferrari, that's an accomplishment on its own"
I retract this statement
He unlapped himself under safety car but they restarted before he caught up with the pack.
Honestly it sucks for Vettel and Leclerc but Ferrari being ass is making this a better race. Also I do think the camera is focusing on the midfield a little more. Although could just be because the midfield is a little higher than normal right now.
Little do we know they started this race with 50% of their full power.
Probably shitty microphones.
"it sounds like it's saying ""whyyyyyyyyyy"" as it goes around"
They got a virus
Yea this is one of the few times I don’t care that much about the midfield
I was always searching for a word to describe Bottas. “Meek” is exactly it.
"If a tin of nails could scream, that would be the sound"
Nails on a chalkboard
Not sure why you say that? Hamilton is consistently faster and well within range. It depends what they’re strategy is.
They got no audience to pan to lol.
They don't have crowds to show
Yes plz
Norris for P3
So i'm not the only one! They are so fkn low on my feed
They would still collect more points than Ferrari somehow :D
Or random celebrities
Well they want to race. Understandable.
Open office
The fact that he's still back in 14th right now is shocking. Ferrari have absolutely fucked this year
"He is ahead of 2 other cars... I guess, small miracles?"
No action.
"No penalty, I think"
For like 15 fucking minutes. What the hell is this production?
"Formula Mercedes, we literally race as one"
I genuinely don’t understand how he still has a seat
As predictable as spanish soap operas
"”I wish Williams could compete with Ferrari again.”

*A finger curls on the monkey’s paw*"
"Vettel should join Kimi at Alfa. They can spend their time chilling with ice cream and wodka, and once in a while they race for fun."
"And Kimi beating Vettel purely on racing abilities without tech issues.

THE  LAST REIGNINGTRUE FERRARI CHAMP"
Albon's were used in quali.
Got to be
yes
Albon on new softs. Has to overtake Perez on old mediums.
Ferrari strategy already having effect.
I really hope it pays off for Alex.
"I'm not, now he has track position with faster tires than the Mercedes. Pitting would sacrifice his chance to attack."
"""But why not just make 10 louder and make 10 the loudest number.""

""...

But this one goes to 11."""
he can go complain to ferrari pepelaugh
especially since it has been multiple seasons...
Now there is 3 of them!
"the sparks dude, I'd need a new racing suit"
not screwed properly?
If he didn’t hit something and break it that means someone on his pit crew didn’t secure it. Someone on his pit team is getting fired I imagine.
"They didn't touch, Vettel managed to stop/spin before touching Sainz, I think."
Unsubscribe
He would have been top ten if the first saftey car didnt shaft hin. Pitted to get the jump on Mag and Ocon. Mag off. Saftey car. Kimis luck.
8 confirmed atm
8 confirmed. But there might be more.
"I believe they’ve only confirmed 4, 2 at Austria, 2 at Sliverstone. They’re working for more"
7 more scheduled probably more to get scheduled
"8 confirmed, some rumored, no idea the total"
"8 confirmed races, more will be announced soon."
It's a complete crapshoot at this point. Hasn't been confirmed at all. Ideally at least 8...
So that means total 16 races then as its 2 at each track
8 confirmed so far. Might be more
"We don't know. 8 races required to have a legitimate world championship. Supposedly 15 races required to fulfill TV contracts and get full payment. Heard somebody mention that there might be up to 18 races. But basically, we don't know, so every races is essential."
With these laps under the safety car they should be able to now.
200IQ knowing there would be another safety car anyway.
He'd lose so much track position as they were still bunched up after the previous SC.
Yeah kind of went unnoticed in the coverage but really solid
Probably incorrect because safety car went through pit?
he didn't
Sensors
Let's have Albon spin Hamilton to 14th
Rightfully so too
Looks like racing incident tbh
There has been two safety cars tbf
"Actually, yes. He's well known for that"
[deleted]
All part of the grand Ferrari master plan.
Wondering why you went to a 6 year old thread for that ubiquitous gif.
leclerc vs sainz in a good ferrari is gonna be INCREDIBLE
"He's a better driver than Hamilton, just needs an equal car to prove it"
Anddd it is happening.
GOOD QUESTION LMAAAAOOO
Proper old-school F1.
POW
I was wondering if someone would retire so he could get point. He did nothing and got to place 11.
Huge help from the safety cars of course.
I don’t know if Hamilton deserved penalty but this result is great for the sport.
That would be so demoralizing for Russell
Russell would likely have been in the points if he hasn't retired.
This race is a point for Latifi short of full meme.
"The final 15 minutes, sure. But the whole race? Today was largely hideous."
Can't blame him lul. But he missed the good part.
Legrerg god
I mean the high podium looks nice still
The three podium pieces usually slot in right next to each other. They're an adequate distance apart I'd say.
yeah they should just use the regular podium.
"It’s not gonna show anything since he was so far ahead. He got robbed. He may or may not have finished, but Hamilton needs to learn how to race instead of always doing ghost laps."
Yeah I definitely like the mclaren / Ferrari team coloured ones
"Yeah, it really helped me to remember my mask when I finally just bought one that didn't look awful."
Or explode. I have faith.
New meme
"Show the midfield when the lead is unreachable.


Show the leaders when theres an actual battle


Its not rocket science"
nope
Employed since 09 no less.
Max could have taken the win with right tyre management
That mic is positioned really badly.
I love the pride colours next to aramco and the bahrain owned mclaren
It was bullshit to bring the cars home safely
please please please
"Honestly, what are they doing. It’s like they both heard “KEEP hitting the curbs please.”"
[deleted]
"Not so different from the usual ""my tyres are dead!! 

*Hamilton fastest lap*

*Hamilton fastest lap*

*Hamilton fastest lap*"
What a piece of crap.
"Doubt it, he didn’t steer towards Albon."
"If not, idk what an overtaking car has to do to gain the advantaged position..

Sky sports team is just insufferable with this incident."
We'll just have to wait for nothing to happen and I guess maybe Red Bull will challenge
Definitely get where you are coming from. It's still a major error from HAM (and probably penalty worthy) but Alex could have yknow given it another corner
And no reliability issues!
"Only half the grid had to retire, another ferrari masterclass"
People had some extra time on their hands. Big teams have extra allowances for little things like this.
"That's what I like about Le Mans, truly amazing machines"
Agree
He understeered into him
If he was a mile ahead there wouldn't have been contact
They’re playing “track is lava”
Social distancing between Kimi's car and its wheel.
"Ya I bet thst changes to spray then drink next race, lol"
Yeah should have sprayed first
Yeah I thought they weren't going to do it because they all took a sip first. Then they spray each other. I know it's a fun part of a grand Prix but it seems counterproductive.
"None of them have covid, everyone at the circuit has been tested many many times. 

The risk is extremely low."
Was thinking the same thing. Also the awards handed out are risky too. It's made contact with other people's hands.
Probably enough ethanol in the champagne to kill the virus.
"can we chill a little bit about COVID, they are not 80 years old, death rate is really low for healthy people."
Lmaoooooo it’s not even funny anymore tho😭
That’s little bit too much
"Obviously haas have some brake issue, but I think they got done in by Ferrari's engine more than anything."
"“Hamilton is still a shit and unfair driver”.

C’mon... control your emotions and employ some of the rational thought you used in the rest of your post."
Is it possible Max's issue is related to RB's half-baked DAS implementation?
nice
[deleted]
this
"And I totally agree with you, having this happening to me in multiple occasions on sims"
Agreed
"I agree ,didn't seem like one to me"
"Yeah, no, he just outbroke himself. Not a great look any which way."
clearly they're glitching
Failing to slow for yellow flags in qualifying.
Not slowing for the yellows yesterday
"Didn’t slow for yellow flag when Bottas went off in Q3, Red Bull complained"
Failing to slow down in yellow flags
Ignoring yellow flag in Q3. Redbull protest last night.
"RBR protested. New on board footage from Lewis’s car showed a yellow light flashing for on the left side of the track, when Lewis was turning right for a second before he went by. Lewis said he didn't see it, Red Bull won the protest. Lewis dropped 3 spots. Max promoted to the front row."
Failure to slow down for a yellow flag in qualifying

Yellow flag violation
Did not slow down under yellow during qualifying
When Bottas drove into the gras in Q3 the marshalls displayed the yellow flag but HAM didn‘t slow down
Ignored the yellow flags when bottas went off. Red bull protested it when initially there was no penalty for HAM and the penalty was only given in the last hour
For no slowing down for the yellow flag during Q3 yesterday when Bottas went off. Penalty was given based on new evidence from onboard Hamilton's car
He ignored the slowdown on a yellow flag in Q3.
"Drove too fast under yellow flag in qualifying, I believe. Dropped 3 grid places."
"He was initially investigated for speeding through yellow flags after Bottas's incident, but the FIA cleared it. Red Bull protested late this morning (maybe new evidence) and the FIA gave Hamilton a 3 place penalty."
Not slowing for yellow flag in quali.
didn't lift for yellows
He ignored the yellow flag caused by Bottas in Q3 to set a lap time.

Ignoring yellows in yesterdays quali. Got a 3 place grid drop like an hour before race start.
Not slowing under yellows in quali. Late decision after Red Bull complained
Russell for a point if he can keep his car going?
"They've barely run these cars. Did the testing and then nothing for 3.5 months.

Plus, I don't mind some unreliability. I remember losing half the grid with alarming regularity. Adds some unpredictability."
"On a totally unrelated note, 4 cars have retired."
"Driver of the day, tied with Hamilton"
he is crushing the opposition
"> Well that's the token Vettel spin of the ~~season~~ race.

FTFY"
(Week)
Let’s hope so.
"I think Russell is the only driver who didn't score a single point in 2019, so I'd love to see him start the 2020 season in the top ten."

Ricciardo being fucked by an engine
i think he just loves the spotlight
"maybe the others dont wanne do it. He is british, british channel."
"It's a different person each race, today is Horner."
"I think he's just one of the less attritional principals, it's guaranteed non-controversial audio"
"They interviewed Renault’s guy for some races last year, same with Steiner for a few I believe."
I think they frequently interview Otmar at Racing Point too
"He's british lol

Just like Toto and Niki used to be the only ones to be interviewed by Austrian broadcaster during the race"
"They tend to have one team per race ""joining them from the pit wall"", although now that I think of it I can only remember Red Bull and Racing Point being that team.

Some people are just more willing to play nice with the media, and Horner is a mega-tart, loves being on camera..!"
Penalize Hamilton.
"Not to take anything away from him, but half the field retired and two more had penalties."
Seriously. That last lap by Lando was critical.
"Yeah, I think he was lucky to keep going after the spin, a point is a point at the end of the day"
"I mean he just needs to stop spinning, sorry"
"Good news though, the break hasn't affected him. He still seems to be in 2019 form. Bad news, the break hasn't affected him and he's still in 2019 form."
"the distance between drivers is about the same, so they might as well use the regular podium"
Everyone gets a Toyota Hilux with a Russian machine gun in the back
Next week is officially the Styrian GP
Styrian
No
Didnt watch espn but she probably said styrian.
Happy times :)
"At his home GP, what a way to start the season! /s"
It's dicks out and away we go!
Podium would be great
lol
POM PIM POM
"No, it’s rather annoying"
"One comment likes it, another doesn’t,"
Gotta get that shitty fast food plug in.
There there buddy...
Whole nother level
Thank you I honestly was losing hopes holy shit he’s holding off good
Almost forgot about that.
"Yeah, so glad I paid $80 to watch the race live only to have the site eat a giant turd right before the race."
"Same here, ffs. I just went back to illegal streaming because the option I pay for, doesn’t fucking work!"
"it's fucked

it's all fucked"
"then vettel to mercedes, EASY"
Williams back at it again... Litterally
"At the start, Leclerc could barely hold off Sainz. They look so slow."
Since Ferrari 2020 is slower than Ferrari 2019 ofc that is the case
No you can just make pace like that
Renault engine.
Vs Red Bull and Mercedes.
"It's a renault engine, what did you expect?"
"Seriously, that's where the racing is. We know the podium. Barring crashes or mechanical failure, it's only a matter of time before Hamilton passes Albon, so there's your 1-2-3. Show us the racing part of the field!"
"a bit?

also holy smookes"
Remember the Mercedes used to smoke a lot last year too.
It's been like that on Sky all weekend. It's not usually like this.
Sounds like a bad stream or a bad speaker setup.
Im getting so pissed my shit will nit work...i keep getting error or this page doesnt exist or it jus loads
Us too. Ugh!
"Right? So boring, they should show midfield overtakes! Would be so much better."
I have troubles. Tried on 2 different PC's anf on the Android app. Nothing f***ing works.
Not working here (France)
Stream... A dude in a shed is making something work a professional organization getting paid isn't able to.
Check your pm
Nope
nope.  fubar
Nope
To be fair Alex didnt offer any resistance bit yeah that was quick
... Yes? I know it's all the vogue to hate on Ferrari but it's the only team that actually is committed to the sport.
"Yeah we do. Every sport is better when legendary teams with the most fans do well. Real Madrid in football, Lakers in basketball, Yankees in baseball and Ferrari in F1 is no different"
"Roses are red, 
Mercedes 1-2,  
Fuck 2020"
"Roses are red

Violets are blue

We're back from pandemic

Mercedes 1-2"
Seems like it
Hopefully. Whatever is wrong with car 33 is one off.
Doesn't look an engine problem
Expecting netflix to connect ocon being late to the start and verstappen engine breaking
Well might have cost us a fight in the first few corners between the mercs!
Maybe they’ll get some points even!
Where do I sign the petition
The budget regulations?
It got boring 4 years ago.
"It might even be ""too late"". Haas and williams might be done before next year if we will have another year like this"
Scenes when they are a second a lap quicker with the new regs.
"Mercedes pitcrew could, if they wanted to."
hold my F1 car
Watch him!
I reckon Checo fell behind for temp management. Hes been following too close too long
Scorchio!
Reverse karma for the genuis move to mclaren
I think they're using a 1.4 from a Fiat Punto
It's just to get heat in. Also a red herring
Maybe they’re being conservative with it right now due to the short season and just want to make winning 2020 as easy as possible?
"- no one, ever"
so much fun! it's what we all want /s
Wish we got to see where sainz could have got without the yellow flag
Feel like it's a toss up between then and racing point
Yeah but Sainz isn't making progress on Leclerc.  Been 1.5-2 seconds behind for a while.  Was hoping he'd be able to catch up to him/Perez.
Don’t be rude. They’re going to win this race.
Was just wondering this. Failures everywhere.
"Based on? Hamilton is always faster than Bottas in race pace, always. Bottas both almost always pushes hard early on heavier fuel and hurts his tires and doesn't manage them well at all. 

He also struggles to setup the car well for a race and generally struggles on the second compound in most races. End of his stints are generally horrible."
He's just tyre/car managing. Hard track to overtake no need for Bottas to push hard at the moment.
"Mercedes have done a good job, however a lot of there advantage seems to be how bad of a job the other teams have done. Mercedes have made a fairly standard step forward in terms of lap time, but others have gone backwards I.e Ferrari and even red bull haven’t made gains.

The other teams just don’t deserve any better to be honest."
"He is in 15th though, and actually ahead of another driver other than a Williams. I’m proud of him! Maybe he’ll actually have a chance at points and overtaking. Hell, I’d even say if a Germany 2019 happened again maybe even a 5th or better."
Yes they press a button
"They can manually activate it when they sre weithin 1sec of s car in front. When they brake, the DRS closes automatically."
"It’s “available,” when the gap is one second or less - then the driver is able to use it as they wish."
There's a button on the wheel the use to open and close the flap
At least it sounds like it has 1000 hp
Sounds like my blender
We have one more midfield team this year 😏
"Yeah I think it’s actually more a microphone issue, it’s distorting."
Merc 1-2
"""I WAS ENJOYING MY VACATION GODDAMMIT!!!!"""
It's not his fault.. The team give the green light
He cant see he just goes when his team tells him to.
Also he's on the Mediums so maybe valued track position?
Probably yeah
"Yes, as is tradition"
It's not usually just a first race of the season thing.
"No luck, they both crashed due to own mistakes"
DAS will help
This is where DAS will shine.
To be fair I'd do a poo if I saw *any* F1 car coming up behind me... I scare easily
"Agreed, at another part of the track it could have been way worse"
Would make the championship alot better
So Albon Norris Perez podium? Subscribe
"Hamilton going wheel to wheel into turn 3 in the last lap, Bottas turns very late and gets a damaged front wing and Hamilton wins."
"Only 3 places off points, come on George!!!"
I think the past 3 year have already answered that question
For real.  its like the last 3 seasons condensed into one race.
"No his fault. His car didn't decelerate enough, so instead of hitting the car in front in the rear, he tried to avoid it by going to the side. It happens to me some times in sims"
Happy Cake Day!
Because he sucks
He probably didn't have time to fully catch the pack before the restart.
Yes
not really. Restarts in formula 1 aren't like NASCAR where everybody lines 2x2 and there's huge passing opportunities. They are lined up single file and the leader controls the restart and will just sail off into the distance
happens yearly
"Can't name a specific race right now but yes, it has happened, numerous times.

A safety car is a soft reset of the grid."
"plenty but in recent times its less critical. In the V8 era 20 seconds margin was critical due to the tires degradation, you couldn't make that time back. In this era you can so even if you lose your advantage you can manage it and still win."
Ferrari panik
Thinking the same. Sounds absolutely awful. A VW Golf sounds nicer.
"The put the mic into the air intake, hence why they are having less power and it sounds like it's in a can"
As thungs stand that will mean Russel P10. Stop I can only get so erect
No
"Despite crofty insisting on banging on about delta between tires, delta between tires only counts for the actual qualifying maximum pace lap where the tires overheat before it ends. At a sustained pace these tires have pretty low actual performance difference and the pace is really just determined by when you pit in the race. Put on any set of tires 30 laps later into a race and they'll be much faster than an old 'faster' compound."
"""Aerodynamics is for Ferrari."" -Enzo Ferrari"
Throwback to this force India mic in the exhaust = angry bees.
The onboard audio sounds like its coming through a radio
"Probably Albon, gotta keep the Mercedes 1-2."
Sounds so bad when they put on throttle
Legit thought he was out
I like Albon but my money is on Checo mainly because of his experience at managing to get podiums.
Why do I smell burnt toast?
Because he's driving a pink Mercedes?
Being a rookie
1000 horses according to cyrille
Pulled a lil sneaky on ya
"There's no need to code it anymore, they can just say it"
No no you have a point
"Nah, I'd say at least 50% of this thread want that"
The merc really works. :(
This is great
He might have some damage who knows
it's almost like theyre doing it on purpose
"So much for diversity, eh? Shame on Merc! /s"
my body is ready!
It’s just team orders in disguise.
Shocking how bad of a monopoly this is by them hah
'vs' is a bold statement
pretty much
Stop! I can only get so erect!
Anyone would look shit in that Haas. I miss Lotus Grosjean
big F
Ferrari Masterplan all coming together
Ferrari best engine!!!!!!
"A slow, reliable Ferrari engine?"
Not at all
It’s just Q3 with extra steps at this point
Probably 2000s.
Don’t be silly!  There’s no other cars after 1-2
The guy is a known “tire whisperer” but even i agree staying out is pretty ballsy
except for mercedes
WELCOME TO MY TED TALK
Thank you for coming to my ted talk
They'd lose more time stacking
Prolly just in case another safety car happens in following laps
Giving him a good taste of the old Ferrari strategy.
Maybe they weren't ready to stack them?
McLaren wouldn’t/couldn’t double stack for some reason.
I just want to wish you all good luck.  We're all counting on you.
Sure we’ve had second safety car. But what about *third* safety car?
Darrel? Is that you?
Ye i swear he was
I think so yes
Perez didn't brake as quickly as albon
Sc before overtake
Albon slowed down for the yellow car quicker
Albon gave the position to him. Probably thought he passed under safety car
"Played it safe in case it would be decided that he overtook him under yellow flag. Probably didn't have to, but hey"
"You're not hearing the commentators 
talking about both Mercs having gearbox issues?"
The Great Ferrari Masterplan
No mercedes still 1 and 2
"Dress rehearsal. It’s the first race after being away for long, short testing time etc. It’s to honestly be expected with all the variables of this year."
Both commentator on French TV said Albon giving back the position is the right thing to do. (But they would have prefer he kept the place)
I think they will have a look at the time of the incident as I have a feeling Kimi’s wheel was off ( and he was parked up) before Albon had passed Perez.
You won't ever see overtaking highlights in F1. You're lucky if there's one noteworthy overtake a race lol
Yep
Is it on or not?
einen* Akkusativ!
WOLFGANG PASS AUF
Everyone does. Verstappen was our best hope of getting a half decent race.
"That's what a professional looks like. Doesn't lock up, continues and gets off."
Hahaha that would be so sick
Yeah cause it happened 2 laps ago
Always make things interesting
Albon. Shouldve had some patience
Hamilton. No doubt.
Albon. Tried to go through the outside and Hamilton just closed the door
He was as wide as he can go..
Everyone knew
Not enough. He was ahead
Very little
not a lot
"I thought he had enough. Although no way FIA penalizes Lewis. 

I stand corrected"
lame
F
Oh we will
"You can’t say that, it’s a Ferrari! 

It’s a shitbox!"
Not when Merc are going to get a 1/2 for 16 races
mechanical failures across the board
We’re still trying to figure it out
They all are rusty
Russell on suicide watch.
Dat boat has sailed LOL
Hehe Williams go vroom
"BS. You out someone of the race you deserve a penalty, 5sec is a joke."
"To finish first, first you must finish!"
I wonder if they’ll ever have a shot at a podium again.
I bet he's sick and tired of bowing to Ham every year
"Wonder if he did it on purpose, would be a smart move."
"Team at fault there, should have swapped and BOT hold up LEC, he’d still have had P1 and HAM P2."
Yup
Team loss for Perez. Not pitting on the final safety car and speeding in piy lane during the previous safety car.
If the Merc is as good as it looks he just got himself a 2 win margin.
This is what Bottas 7.0 looks like
He's had a fair chance every year.
"If he hadn't made the mistake chasing Perez, Norros could have been second too."
Likes low fuel and hard tyres by the look of things.
For every race like this there is a 2019 French Grand Prix
Same. What a race!
I'm a new fan and have been obsessed since just after Brazil 2019 and this has been an incredible first race to see.
"So far, yes"
Albon was ahead what is this
Is that you Nico?
Justice!
😂😂😂
>I am inevitable
It was like this even 3 days ago
Cause his car is also broken
[deleted]
"Let’s be honest, he didn’t have a chance."
"That's unfair, Gene Haas is much more reputable than the dildo brothers. GSB out."
Racing is racing
His best.
his best
Stroll 2.0
Showing us how woeful an actual pay driver is
Being the slowest driver in the slowest car.
He just vibing
"He's probably not fazed, either."
Hahahah
"Pleeeasse. I want to hear that ""Nooooooo"" from Hamilbaby"
Nope
Must be your first season if you think we get anything else.
Irritating. But all the splits are at least 2 seconds between all the cars apart from Ocon and Kvyat and Vettel and Russell.
"Albon Sainz Norris

/subscribe"
"Perez didn't slow down, ridiculous. That plus the pit incident should get him a penalty."
All these safety car laps may have saved them.
yes
"Driving that shitbox to second, truly an amazing job by Leclerc."
Button is a skinny boy and has zero ass lol
"Yeah - I noticed this before the race, it's a tad obscene."
Its called payback.
An Albon win would be beautiful
I wouldn't be surprised if they still won. I'm starting to feel like they can drive in reverse and still win.
Payback? Did you see the move Albon made on Hamilton in the beginning? It was exactly the same.
Leclerc might deserve it though
Yes they do. They were shit in qually but in the race they have been much better
Why? It's not their fault that their engine is so weak it doesn't break during race... wait a moment.
Lewis doesnt know how to yield. Its weird to see him act like this when getting passed.
Agreed
"Couldn’t have said it better mate, fuck Hamilton."
Hahaha
Isnt he fucking awesome?
Twice
"He’s a really nasty driver when he isn’t leading, cold blooded"
Twice both to albon
"Aside from the last 3 races, not very many. Lewis is one of the cleaner racere out there."
And starting in 7th - amazing race by him
Agreed!
Raikkonen over took Russell. At least show us it!
"Yeah, why did I pay them $80? I can't even watch the race. I'm going to have to wait until its over and watch it on youtube or something. Beyond frustrated."
Their race pace is scheduled to be bad though
"""Alex, Max's car is broken, we're going to need to give him yours, box please"""
At least it's intact for them to reuse next week.
Lewis was halving the lead as it was.
"He’s been reeled in since HAM is P2, SC only sped things up by 5 to 10 laps."
"Bottas has new tires, I'm sure he's relieved, Hamilton wouldve been on his ass in a few laps anyways."
Make him the Pope! 🙏🏼🙏🏼
"Multi 21, Lewis, multi 21."
Shows Ferrari driving alone.
"Anything ""2-1"" sounds like team orders to let someone pass"
Same with Ferrari
Don’t stop there. We should give the drivers turtle shells or banana peels that they could throw at each other.
"Even better, let's just make actual marble racing the pinnacle of motorsports."
lol
Naw if anything it'll be mechanical failure. Remember they're not Ferarri.
It’s a racing incident but I think it’s more sided with Hamilton cause he just comes up while Albon is there
"There was not enough place for Albon, he shouldn’t have tried that overtake"
"Because its Lewis, the fucking pedestal boy, the sport licks his arse for breakfast"
"He is Hamilton, thats how. Get used to him getting protected whenever smth happens"
It probably is. Investigation is going on
Imagine Bottas crashing out or gearbox issue lol
Amazing.
B-25J N6123C
So excited I tried to wake up my 6 year old to watch with me (USA west coast). He wasn’t as excited lol.
"Even though I'm a Max fan, subscribe."
Link for streM???
I feel that. I'm all shaky and excited. Enjoy the race!
"I was okay with them sucking shit the first season because it was new, there are literally people from all over the world connecting, but now this is unacceptable. Especially this year when they knew no one would be able to watch in person, so EVERYONE who wants to watch F1 this year has to stream it. 

I don't get how they can be so incompetent. I found a bootleg stream working better than their site."
Do you have an apple or android? It's working on my android but not chrome on the PC.
Apparently
"Just before the race, they did it before"
"Why, what's happening on ESPN?"
??
No drink seb
sportsurge
Gentleman....FOOOORRRMM UUP
Its down. You can access the site but not stream
"But within a second of the car in front, which is a big improvement."
Haha mediums go brrrrr
If he can stay within a few seconds he has a > 50% shot at winning imho
Vaping Point
Why did I laugh as loud as I did to this
Bottas isn't racing anyone. who wants to see a Mercedes flying around by itself
It is a joke. Really regret wasting my money for this 'service'
"I paid for live, dammit!"
Not working in Argentina... Just a spinning wheel since a couple of minutes before the broadcast should have started!
*Imperial March intensifies*
"Car just isn't quite there with the top teams yet.

ETA: Uh, oh! A window just opened for him!"
Was just thinking it was one of the least eventful starts I've seen in a while.
"> Is it from soft to hard and fast and not durable to slow and durable or what?

Yup."
Basically.
"Yes, basically"
"The soft tire is the fastest, but wares the most, the medium sits in the middle for both pace and wear while the hard is the slowest but also the most durable."
And the pink Merc.
"Not even that, it’s just Max Verstappen at this point."
tyres overheating?
More Gearbox maybe
On a black plate now
yeeeeew go Alex!
Yeah. This fucks up the season. With Verstappen being the only one that could ever have a shot at challenging the mercs this season him starting the season this badly essentially means the season is over before it has barely begun
"Yeah, I have a feeling this will be the closest fight of the year."
You have 20 fingers on one hand?
"it's lap 15 of 71, mate. plenty of time."
All at once this year probably
Yes
I’d take Bottas over Vettel around lap 55.
"Hey, at least it lasted to Austria this year instead of looking over by Australia."
Don;t worry. He'll peak in the McLaren.
And Stroll's Mercedes also with engine problems
Stroll's Mercedes is next.
"""To finish first you first have to finish"""
Lol welcome back in 2018
Every year they've raced ever.
The silver lining about Max being F is that we're getting a different face for 3rd.
3 lol
and it is an easy track on the PU
lol
Seriously!
Inb4 Ferrari gets punished for something Merc does regularly
Their best
#justFerrariThings
Only Mercedes is allowed to do them
sounds like it‘s sucking in half of the atmosphere
The turbo
Sportsurge(dot)net
*Brain failure*
Yeah has to be
"Glad it's not just me, I thought it was my stream or my headphones"
Whomstve among us
Shit I just hope Haas is still on the grid next year.
Brake failure for Kmag - can't really excuse Grosjean tho
https://media1.tenor.com/images/f870f5724dcc36f3cc4fea5238099ba1/tenor.gif
"It should be by the looks of it, there definitely wasnt time for him to get out in front"
"Here me out... And I say this as a verstappen fan so it will hurt me to say.

But imagine he retires again next race. His championship would be destroyed, he leaves Red Bull due to his performance clause, and then partners with Hamilton at Mercedes in 2021. 

You heard it here first."
🙏🏼🙏🏼I hope so
He doesn't have the pace
please no jinx  😂
Yeah cause he pitted lap before
"Yes, lost 15 seconds"
"No, far from it actually."
"No - however if we think how sensitive these cars are, this is the first race in a long time, and other variables I’m not too surprised. It is disappointing."
No
"Not this early and this many issues, usually"
"No, but it's not atypical either"
Or let the lapped cars fall to the back of the snake
I was thinking the same thing. Looked really grained right on the inside edge.
Amen to that :(
Because he is bad.
Lapped car unlapped himself under safety car?
Nah it was drs. It's a stupid zone
"How much of that do you think is the car, or lack of experience with the racing lines and brake zones, or just holding back due to nerves?"
Dont jynx alex's first podium! 😭
Never
Just after he overtakes Bottas.
Yes 🤣 he has a set of binoculars with him to look into the pits
With a spyglass
Same shit different f1 season.
Ehhh Mclarens race pace is really nothing special from what we've seen so far. Doesn't seem much faster then Ferrari.
"Nothing, I don't think. He's just bad"
*implying there's any chance it won't be HAM*
In the non sky sports F1 package you can select which on board you can watch. I just got a better pirate package because with my last one i just had sky etc. No i have the on boards too it's quite amazing to watch an on board and the race at the same time!
Sammich
That would be amazing. But I think it was realistically only be a result of some more retirements or catastrophic mistakes.
Some sort of sensor issue
Electrical Sensors issue
Sensor failure.
Engine issues it seems. Drove straight into the garage.
Engine issue
Engine issues
Engine issues
Engine problems
The Mercedes power unit is acting up today and stroll had to retire because of that
engine overheating / losing coolant from what I heard
Engine issues. Drove straight into the garage prior to safety car
He went Right into the garage. Engine problems
Retired due to engine issues.
"Idk I'm pretty sure mics are the same on all the cars and mics should be fine, it's just literally how cars sound, sorry, it's not V10s anymore"
Sounds like its picking up the sound from the turbo pressure to me.
Well shit.
And vettel still behind
"He had lost 15 seconds to the DRS train in front immediately after the SC restart, not a lot more since regular racing resumed."
I'm pretty sure Latifi was already 10 seconds behind when the safety car went in. He did pit a lap after everyone else. Good chance he didn't catch up in time.
"I couldn't fault them, they've taken a massive beating all weekend and next weekend is still to come"
"Oh, did you see them switching to hikers in the woods yesterday?"
"I prefer it this way. I never gave a shit about the crowd or a random celebrity, I want to watch the cars."
me right now
New to F1? The midfield only exists in our hearts.
"you must be new here.. contractually obliged to show 50% Merc, 40% Ferrari, 10% DRS pass replays."
There is fuck all action on track
The only thing the weird 2020 doesn't touch is a Merc 1-2. We can only dream for the above podium...
F1.75 is where it's at.
This race doesn’t seem to get more interesting...
"win for first podium would be spicy

“Look at me I’m Red Bull now” - Albon"
">Also, how bad is the new Ferrari engine? Seriously

FIA(T) bad?.."
He is washed
Are we still in 2016?
2019 merc so dominant it gets a podium in 2020!
Gamble on podium I guess. Track position but on the other hand Albon and both McLarens could get him
"I think they're risking it against the limping Mercs, if Mercedes have a problem then Perez could potentially go for the win."
I doubt he’s the one making those calls. They have strategists for that.
not like he fixed the tire himself
[removed]
"4 I think, at Monaco one year"
monaco 96' ?
3 or 4 I think
"There's no tether for a wheel, it's for the wheel hub assembly if the suspension breaks."
He could have won this so hard
He said it so many times it actually happened
Daddy paid good money
I am sure Alfa gets punishment.
You clearly never seen a 90\`s race
Maybe the softs they had were used and the mediums were fresh?
Did he have softs available? If they only had used softs then a new set of mediums is probably better.
Because they are probably faster over anything but 5-6 laps.
Nope deemed safw i think so
"None yet, thought for sure there would be one."
at least he's got 3rd place given back
pls dear god
I'm just waiting for his car to break down too.
We can confidently say that they were fiddling around with their engines but we can’t confirm
Seeing it wrong. Albon should not of tried to send that around the outside of lewis.
It's a miracle he's even in the points
Without the spin hes probably 6th or higher
Home circuit no less
"Albon didn't fail, he got fucked"
Different than Vettel's contacts
"Al on did the same thing in lap one and Hamilton backed off, Alvin didn’t back off and span."
Im startin to think he just dont give a fuck
> I got that reference.
Yikes
"Sounds like they had some reliability issues, turned the engine down and now in the last laps seem to be more confident about that car not exploding?"
Ikr...its like me waking up early morning after sleeping at 3
That’s why Vettel and Ferrari are a perfect fit.
"That's' honestly a stupid penalty. This is a clear racing incident. But of course, again favoring Red Bulls in Red Bull land"
"I dont know if you're watching, but Vettel is 11th and outside the points."
He's in 2nd right now with the penalty.
One crazy race!
Yes
Well thank god I was wrong!
"Half the field is out, lmao. Still last and of the points."
FAKE NEWS. Banned from r/TheRussell
GOOD QUESTION
Nine*
Ruined Albons race and still gets 3rd
"For ruining someone's race, AGAIN. 3 Races later."
I was shouting at the TV for the last two laps for them to let Lewis through. Chance of a 1-2 even if they'd done it soon enough.
"No, Sainz has a 5 second penalty for speeding in the pit lane."
Well it was due to so many retirements and Hamilton penalty but still!
"Abu Dhabi was after Brazil, 2 out if 3 though!"
The 180 they’ve done over the last couple years is honestly just amazing. Love to see it
he could have stopped on track for a yellow then lewis would have scored no points
man i feel bad for Albon so bad. all his mates got podium and not him
Engine failure
Lewis made contact with him and he spun into the gravel
"Crashed with Hamilton, causing a 5 second penalty to Ham"
Brazil 2019 2.0
DNF
What are they supposed to do? Put Albon who is now in 12th on the podium?
Sometimes it's so nasty. Albon loses everything. Hamilton only 5 sec
Like a classic Ben Shapiro excuse
"I swear some people see something completely usual and be like ""woah thats magic how are they so good????"". It's low speed on a straight"
It's really hard to remember that the safety car is a supercar being driven really damn hard. And yet the F1 guys are weaving all over the show just trying to keep their tires functional.
2018 again
"going through the pit, or it would be a ghost penalty"
50
Consider it done!
You called it.
It's almost like Hamilton's PR is completely divorced from Hamilton's racing
Redbull get a penalty for causing a car to retire from the race
Me too haha
Sainz Sainz Sainz
He wouldn't have won tho
"To be fair if Bottas had let Hamilton through then Bottas still would have won and Hamilton probably would have held on to 3rd. It was the smarter decision, but I'm glad the winner was the person first across the line"
"He has a 5 sec penalty, moving him past Bottas was to keep him on podium"
Weren't they saying to let Hamilton pass to give him free air to extend the gap to Lando in an attempt to preserve 3rd? As Bottas had the win regardless.
Brundle should make sure he cups the balls when he sucks off HAM after the race
[deleted]
Lucky sky sports sucking Hamilton’s ass is the only F1 coverage I get in this country
"It would not have given the win, it would have saved Lewis 3rd potentially"
"Ummmm yeah, but he had the penalty and it would have given him the chance to keep a podium position. Makes sense to be honest."
Also no crowd shots that take away from the action!
No more pointless grandstand images!
"> it’s not Mercedes fault.

I don't get why everyone blames Mercedes. At least 2 other teams have comparable budgets and resources, yet fail to surpass them every year."
[deleted]
You don't even get to watch them lol
"lol ""shocking"""
Team FIA [https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/04/formula-one-teams-threaten-court-action-over-ferraris-secret-engine-deal-with-fia-motor-sport](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/04/formula-one-teams-threaten-court-action-over-ferraris-secret-engine-deal-with-fia-motor-sport)
they showed a single replay of Gasly passing with DRS
Oh it’s coming
Bono my bones are shaking
Albon FTW
"An Albon, Perez and Norris podium would be the best thing I’ve ever seen"
Literally nothing else is happening
F1 has needed some sort of a team 'salary cap' for a while now.
So fkin true . Feeling gutted for him (from a Ferrari fan who is already gutted)
Was that a driver cockup or Haas's brakes going on strike again?
"Not his fault, it's a brake failure just like Mag"
Albon - Norris -  Perez
"As a Mercedes/Hamilton fan, I'd be ok with that."
At this rate latifi will get a point if he can bring it to the chequered flag
Rarely this much of a mess though
I mean that's a purely racing incident I don't see how you can blame either
He did though. He said Albon was ahead
I thought they were letting the drivers police themselves now
Brundle said something so fuck Lewis. Pretty bright!
Still got 6 titles
I expect a Red Bull appeal. Horner already on the phone probably
The pass looked legit to me
inb4 Mercs and Checo podium
"Would be nice if Albon got it but I wouldn't write off LeClerc quite yet. Saying that, Ferrari pace seems way off."
Intersting tactics
i love you
17 November 2019?
😢😢😢 lmao
That’s hilarious
MyTiReSaReDeAd
Tyre life matters lad
Hopefully more than 5 sec
Racing incident
"Diversity for me, not for thee!

/s"
I wonder why they don't want reverse grid races. Lewis would be banned before the season was over.
What are you on about? He didn't steer left into him or anything. It was a racing move and ended in a collision. His wheel never changed angle and he tried to leave room.
🤣🤣
">there goes the race 

More like there goes the season"
Go and watch porn instead
I hope it’s just the frustration of having to drive that „car“
eh sainz got cut off by charles and had to break harder than usual; vettel should have been more attentive though
he was ahead tho.
Perfectly legitimate overtake though.
He was ahead
That's not how racing works buddy. It's not his fault Hamilton ran him wide
"No, both Hondas shit the bed"
i knew this was gonna happen but its still disappointing
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT!? HE IS A 4 TIME WORLD CHAMPION! /s
Germany last year was a hilarious shit show too
Enjoy!
It’s a crime
GP2 engine!!
"Yeah, in a car 1 sec faster"
Cya
Meh. A damaged Mercedes engine  is probably as fast as a perfect Ferrari engine atm.
"I would, but I couldn’t stand it."
Russell 25 points plsss
Or engine issues. Something is still not right with them..
Seems like that'll be the only thing that might make an exciting race anymore...
Spot on
He unlapped himself
Yeah what the fuck :/
Safety car is pretty quick
I think he got released during the safety car to unlap himself so he wasn’t part of the big queue
Late pit stop maybe?
Well it’s Williams after all
"He was lapped before the SC, so he was released and hadn't caught the tail up by the time SC went in."
He was simply unlapping himself under SC. Had too little time to catch up to the field
I'm curious as well. Maybe from where Botas slowed down and sped up it made a slingshot like effect and he was on the end of it?
Yes
"Yes, yes they are..."
Well. Considering RB is clearly quicker probably not. Unless RB has reliability issues every week.
"Imho at this rate the Constructors championship will finish:

1- Mercedes

2- Red Bull

3-Mclaren

4-Racing Point

5-Ferrari"
Sounds like that guy that blows into the tin can to produce engine sounds lol
 L A N D O T I M E
And points for Russel!
You're a quick learner!
if max was in the race it would be different
Since 2014? Yes with a year or two where it was differemt.
"They've won every championship for the last 8 years. So, yeah pretty much.

To be fair in 2017, 2018 and 2019 they had ""some"" competition but this is like 2016 levels of dominance"
Yes. This sport is mostly boring unless a freak race happens.
"Yes, and usually they don’t have problems."
"Yes, except they rarely have issues."
"No, Mercedes usually never have problems and almost always run away with 1st and 2nd. The last 2 years weren't this bad, but this reminds me of 14-16 when the Mercs would pull out multi-second leads over just a few laps."
"That's how it's been through this era of engine/aero rules, but there's new regulations starting in 2022 (as well as a freeze on development for all non-aero parts at some point in 2021), so there's at least some hope for the future lol"
Too early in the season to tell. It’s also highly track specific. Typically Red Bulls are much better on more twisty tracks that are less reliant on engine power. They probably will be at least closer in Hungary.
"For the most part, but there’s always the odd Vettel, Verstappen, or Leclerc win where there’s no DNFs or problems."
"Just the running-away bit.  Concerns about Mercedes reliability, much less actual issues, are historically very uncommon."
"Pretty much, Mercedes have dominated for years now will be interesting if Hamilton goes for the overtake. The entertaining battle will 3rd 4th"
Usually without the problems though. This new year is very different to previous though. Last year we got to know the strengths and weaknesses of cars like the Merc and Ferrari and see them each have their moments. Quite often though it’s Mercedes out front controlling the race
They sense the gearbox
"They measure Liberty Media's level of annoyance with Mercedes dominance. When they go over certain levels, a random Mercedes engine explodes.

No, I'm joking - they actually measure how angry Toto will get if a Mercedes 1-2 is not guaranteed."
They are sensors on the gearbox. They sense things to do with the gearbox
They sense the gearboxes
How much is payout?
Eh. Alex deserves his first.
He will be fucking smoked by everybody. Hope i am wrong.
Hahaha funny funny
Red bull and issuing formal complaints go together like Mercedes and championships
Protest incoming /s
tfw when the ENTIRETY of one of your Fantasy teams has retired. Every single driver AND the constructor of choice.
The fact that Norris doesn't punt of Leclerc the next lap says otherwise.
"If I spear you, my steering angle was consistent."
He can take out Leclerc next
"Probably, they are doing it in most of the European sports. Watching EPL or Bundesliga is comical with the fake sounds."
Don't think so?
Helicopter I think. Or the cooling fans on the intakes.
I read somewhere a while ago that they will play fake sounds. Don't know if it is true or employed in this race.
"Yes, no way to change layout here"
"Same layout, reversed isn’t done because its dangerous, run-offs are built to handle cars in only one direction."
You mean the Renault that's still getting annihilated by their customer team ?
"Oh yeah they're having a blinder in 10th and 15th, should focus on their own problems"
*Laughs in 10th and 15th*
Not anymore...
You were saying?
Bring on 2021.
If this os a forgettable race than I don't know what would need to happen to make it memorable for you.
Ahh reminds me of the before times
"Have you seen his bank account, though?"
"Bruh this is his first race and he's lapping within 0.1 seconds of Russell and is faster than the Haas cars too.

Williams didn't even give a flying shit about him when it comes to pit strategy."
I can get on board with an Albon - Perez - Norris podium haha
"People bitching about Lewis complaining.

Yep, all is well and normal in the universe."
"They can take a long time but its safety 1st, no need to risk peoples lives over a couple of minutes"
"Yeah I don’t know what he was on about there, Albon got completely fucked over by Hamilton again"
Yeah that corner had Albon’s name on it like wtf
Schumacher was much worse.
this surfing new is providing many laughs. How long has new been the recommended sort for races?
"It's fucking Hamilton, he always gets away."
Or two
or 2
You spelled Hamilton wrong
I have a dollar that says one of them breaks down
"Albon was almost fully ahead of Hamilton there, defo Hamilton's fault imo"
"Hamilton: *""Hold my DAS""*"
"How far does it extend?  Just the races, or the entire industry behind it?"
rain can
"Well, except F1TV not working."
"Yesterday was like Christmas for me, I swear."
I expect a crash tbh
Sportsurge
Go to sportsurge
How do you qualify P13 while in Q3?
"Good point, engineers in the garage must have told him before the final run that his initial lap could be deleted"
"If he'd given up on the second lap, he wouldn't have the penalty for exceeding track limits. So he'd be 10th (or 9th if his aborted lap was still faster than Ricciardo's aborted lap)."
What decade is it?!
"He is.
And he does it for his family"
That background hook.... Could you be loved
I’m watching on ESPN and it was there? I’m on Hulu tho
Thank you! Lifesaver!
"Considering we have the 70th Anniversary GP coming up, I think they might have shuffled stuff back for that."
Two seconds Ted= Triple  Drink
He is also great on lap 1.
Haven't we all.. Let's hope for a great race!
Yep f1tv is broken for me too
penalty
Not slowing down under yellows when Bottas ran off during qualifying.
Received a penalty for yellow flag shenanigans.
He was handed a three place grid penalty for not slowing down during yellow flags in qualy
I'd like to know as well
So he can lay down rubber for grip
I can see it. thats just typical Simon smh
The only valid reaction
I endorse this statement.
Formation lap is ending
Yeah the RP's have had that all weekend.
It's a race for 2nd!
Why? He's shown before he's totally fine with battling team mates and they aren't even on the same team this year.
Well he is going to Ferrari...
Don't jinx it!
"Yep, cant watch"
Me too. Broken as fuck.
"Everybody is having trouble with F1 TV. Seems they completely dropped the ball. Thank god I decided to splurge on a German Sky 1 month ticket, just in case (I already expected F1 TV issues) - that works perfectly (even though I do not like the commentators)."
Please I prefer Tracing Point
Vape gods
:(
Disappointing
[deleted]
Well fuck......
Jinxed it
No DRS or tow.
Oops. Maybe not.
You were saying?
Ocon is crap in comparison
Seen many complaining
"I honestly don't really notice it, but maybe because I've gotten used to it watching football the past few weeks."
"Try mamahd, doesnt seem to have a big delay"
"This makes it more exciting, Lewis and Bottas can fight now Without Max getting in the way."
It's you m8
Bad car
Did they try force quit /s
Monkey paw curls
Safety car to come into play?
"Of course he can, he did it almost every races he won in the past"
Its Lewis mate. Watch him.
No
"i think he changed engine mode and he lost power, and every time he tried to change the mode again he would go into anti stall"
Looks like he switched engine maps or something and the software crapped out.
"Its not great either, LEC has fallen back from Perez and Norris. VET cant get past STR"
No its even worse than quali pace!
About that
"Ferrari engine is dogshit, Alfa suffering as well"
Just waiting for next year probably
At least 3 more.
"But he’s on for a podium atm, I don’t see anyone else catching him"
Even worse is it's a Force India with engine issues
"Yea, because 2 years ago they provided a WDC car which Vettel proceeded to bin it"
Shouldn't we wait for the engine to cool down so we don't burn our mouth on the exhaust pipe?
Internet hugs
"It is! It occasionally refreshes randomly for me, but it is back up."
What a yoke
Dropped two places to Gasly and Kvyatt rn he’s not looking good
Yes hahaha
He made it easy for him
"Ditto, I doubt very much he'll get by though. Maybe get some last lap fireworks a la 2016 though :D"
"Working? Yes
Working Well? No"
"DON'T JINX IT

edit: you jinxed it :(("
Honda is sweating bullets right now
What exactly is a tracker?
Tortoise and the hare baby. Claire is playing the long game
BWT runs merc engines?
P15!
Or get out and let an owner that really wants to be in F-1 have a shot at a team.
So Gasly or Ocon to win then?
"So far so good!


Edit: Sorry! I mozzed em!"
"Ah, the race is still young"
Hey so yeah remember that thing I said?
"To be fair on Ferrari, that's normally a Mercedes thing."
its boring germany
its boring 🇩🇪
"I was thinking this when they released the liveries, they look like sister cars"
Don't forget RB
"Why not both, let's hope the Mercedes manage to retire"
Looks like we might not need one...
Lmao
Maybe since he has to follow blue flags? Or it's just a mistake.
"If anything it would make it worse, less cushioning through the large sidewall"
"It would be more severe with the 18 inch. The huge sidewalls absorb the bumps more, with an 18 inch wheel, there's hardly any sidewall."
Probably more severe. Less wall to absorb the impact with a larger wheel.
Yeah he’s gonna win this race
People like to focus on the speed of the Merc while forgetting that Hamilton is a fucking fantastic driver. Bottas is no slouch by any means.
maybe the intern chose the wrong H ? superhards from 2 years ago
Clearly lost brakes
What? We saw a ton more Vettel than anything of the mercs
Lost his brakes maybe ?
Deadass sounds like my Dyson lmao
“i think ericcson hit me”
Albon is Thai for the purposes of records isn't he?
They really might if they don't have an engine issue themselves. i'm not sure Russell has the pace to pass the cars ahead of him
"nah that is textbook handling, he even yielded when he noticed he was just a tad behind norris, fair play"
Pitted at the wrong moment ... I mean Alfa are a Ferrari sister team so of course their strategy is awful
Its insane how everything just works out for them
"It's just crofty saying ""BRRRRRRRRR"""
It sounds like they moved the mic into the exhaust
They sound awful don't they
Watching the Ferrari garage is just hilarious
100%
Williams
"Let’s be honest, what do they have to lose?"
Their goals are beyond your understanding
Their goals are beyond your understanding
Probably gonna try to overtake Lando
Same as Hamilton
Lasting very long on tires is kinda his trademark though
Why? They went 25 laps with used softs. They can surely make 44 laps with 4 or so laps under the safety car with mediums.
Yes
Yes
Yup. His car is in a bad spot.
"on mediums? easily, but we will see how fast"
"Yeah, the fronts did not work and rear locked."
right front brake failure
right front brake disc failure
Looks like it. Front right had tons of smoke coming out before the failure. Might be a broken disc
"Brundle said so. Looked like it too, he's not THAT much of a vanker"
Ya they did. They released Lando just in time to not impede Carlos
"Since Sainz was apart of it, they won’t show it."
"I want to root for him but I have a feeling that it will then end with him spinning at the end of race for Latifi to get the 10th place, Germany 2019 style."
Better than not racing at all
And this is why I keep wishing they extend the points to 15 position
why not both?
Rears?
Cars that have been lapped during the race. Like Latifi
Cars that were a lap behind
"Cars who are not on the lead lap, i.e., the leaders of the race overtook those in the back."
Cars that were so slow as to be overtaken by the Bottas and thus be a lap behind
A car that’s lapped means they are +1 lap behind another car.
Cars that have been lapped by the leading car. Effectively making all cars on a rolling grid start from their current position.
“Lapped car” means the car is more than a lap behind the leader
"Cars that have been lapped by the car leading the race. They were a lap down before, now they are all on the same lap again"
Cars that have been lapped by the leader
"No, lapped cars are those in the last place which have been ""lapped"" by those in first place. So they are a whole lap behind the leading car.

Lapped, Definition: ""being one or more laps behind in a race. A lapped car is at least one lap behind the car in first place."""
Maybe he picked up some rubber bits off the track?
Honorable sacrifice
Thought the same. Classic Crofty
Trying to make up for the car. Desperate lunge.
Agreed.
Excessive retirements
The trick is not to crash or spin
They didn’t pit him when the safety car came out so we’ll see how that works out.
Didn't notice. Amazing
"4 are out, Gro spinned, RAI pitted before SC and Sebastian... Well he spun"
"spins (grosjean and vettel), and a double stack at alpha?"
I guess he was really frustrated in 2018 too.
I’d really like to see Albon on a podium as well. I became a fan after watching the Netflix episode about him.
"Well...it's not really hard when the HAAS is a pile of todd, 3 retirements, a brand new rookie in driving a barge and spinny Boi did an spin."
Vettel can’t even catch Grosjean bruh I can’t believe it
Braun gp v2
"Mercedes is turning the engines down

*[tinfoil hat on]*

But some more than others."
Wtf where did they say that? Powering down =/= team orders. Stop putting words into their mouths
Pretty cool how we watched a Ferrari 1.5 sec behind another car instead of it
Their drivers fighting for first
Fam how you leave off Red Bull lol
[deleted]
What about red bull
Yes 😍
Just barely! The midfield all seems within a DRS zone if they can close the 0.4/0.9 gaps.
"If you’re referring to the onboards, the audio has been out of sync with the graphics/video for years."
"Yep. Looking at r/F1TV it seems we're lucky it even ""works""."
It’s still got a Williams chassis...
Merc engine isn't god mode like some people here claim. F1 is a aero dependant formula and Williams car isn't that good
What are you talking about? He moved up 4 positions without any effort. :P
Legit sounds like there's sand in the engine lmao
we don't talk about that shush
Lmao
"They're very bumpy, and because of the pandemic spare/replacement parts are more limited than normal"
They stick out
It's fucking depressing
Used it during safety car to keep temperature in the tyres.
Hopefully literally
"Okay, heres Hamilton.. now back to Bottas"
Its the gearbox not the PU
Would be cool if we saw any of that instead of the Merc train
Vibrations.
"They’re ridged, so they’re sending a load of vibrations through the car. Would probably be fine on other tracks, but the bigger curbs here have done most of the damage. The ‘standard’ curbs just aren’t helping."
Because curbs are very hard and not even. At those speeds that kind of vibrations do a lot of damage.
They can just ask Ted to start talking again afaik they can't with radios
They’re just winding us up mate
">kerbs are lava

Made me chuckle. Thanks!"
We've seen worse.
Lando gonna win calling it now
"Well, they keep renewing the contracts of these two chucklefucks; that's the first problem"
Stop noticing things
"The eighties called, they want their reliability issues back."
Failure most likely.
Brake failure by the look of it
"Brakes problem for both cars, at the same corner"
Failure
Brake failure
Plow into the Mercedes I beg you
Absolutely
"Absolutely. Think he's on Leclercs level, honestly."
"I'd say he'd be top 10 in a decent car, yeah"
He could easily finish in the points with a better car
I don't think he had any left?????????????
And we'll do it all over again next week. And people thought these wouldn't be great double headers
Its just going to be 8 episodes of Gunther psychologically torturing Romain in front of the team. And then people saying how endearing his swearing is.
No
For first race yes
No lol
"Nope, definitely not for a dry race"
"Nope, not really"
Nope :)
No
Was normal in like 2000s.
Quite high but nothing unusual
This is quite a lot. Usually maybe 2 at most
"no, at least not in this era (6 years after the first introduction of the V6's)"
Otherwise perez would switch to soft and keep his 4th position
Haha
Probably don't have new softs left.
Little Latifi has impressed me a lot today.
Or nervous as fuck
Yes
"Pink Mercedes beats black mercedes, what a strange time that would be"
Or is it all just made up nonsense???
Stroll retired for the same issue
"The floor on those Mercs look *low*, so I'd guess it's just an issue on their specific car design"
I think they would have ended up behind Perez / Albon...
he gave position back :(
The front fell off
Looked a little greedy. Good move by Alex.
"I want Williams to get points, but not Latifi. What a tough choice to make."
lol imagine SC driver getting out to drink coffee or something and goes *again*
then the wheel would have fallen off. it was only the rubber
Really? I’ve barely seen any racing
And all technical
"duel of the century, seb vs lat......"
You've chosen a pretty dramatic race.
"This circuit is a car breaker, and cars are unreliable due to the long break"
"This track is hell on cars at the best of times, but this is also the first race of the season so the cars haven't been finessed like they normally would by this point."
"There's always a couple, because of how stressful races are on the cars and how easy they are to crash, but this race is exceptional for how many have retired - it's normally around 2 or 3"
Well it is not the worst possible day but yeah the safety cars and retirements are abnormal.
"There's not usually this many, but the German GP last year was absolute chaos, well worth watching."
Normally get ~1 safety car a race and a couple of retirements but this has been particularly hectic. Don’t see it as the worst day to start following f1 - this is so much more entertaining than a race with no retirements
Thanks guys for all the responses.
Aged like milk
:(
What?
Brazil 2019: hey
Lol I wondered who gilded you so quick
lol.
lol I mean i would never have thought that would be possible
"This season, outside of Mercedes being first, will probably be like the rest of 2020. A new shitshow with unpredictability every week"
Maybe his car is in worse shape
"I think he is on the podium, since Perez is punished too...

Edit: Fastest last lap, 4.9 seconds behind Hamilton (who has a 5 second penalty), he just bloody done it!"
Luck
Poor albon. He’s gonna get his though.
They forgot this is not a virtual gp anymore
TwitchBoiz
All that weight saving worked...
It is what it is
That’s what good friends do
Sky analysis for an hour or so
Stuff on Sky F1. Other than that maybe check F1TV or wait for stuff on YouTube
You hate to see it
I would say it should be a 5 second stop go like what Vettel got France 2018
"Come on lad, the race isn't just at the front for goodness sake."
"Please do, if that's all you watch F1 one for then f off"
"Don't talk about it, do it."
"To my knowledge, yes"
That would be so much drama
Wish granted Bottas's PU will explode letting Hamilton coast to the finish instead of having to race against Bottas.
The car is so slow... Every opportunity that opens up has to be taken...
"Yeah that's utter bullshit.
He had some great races from behind. 
He is frustrated and in a poor mental state but not a bad driver by any means."
Fuck now I realise theres no cooldown room...
"That was my thought, but they are saying the gearbox issue is critical."
"He has 10 laps and he's on better tyres, and he tried to overtake around the outside of turn 4. That's textbook impatience"
Since Brazil last year lol
Brazil 2019
Brazil last year
Sainz got P3 last year
Last year in Brazil
Since before the Honda troubles I think.
Not that long. Sainz got one last season.
Brazil last year?
A few months since the last time they got a podium off Hamilton’s 5 sec penalty for crashing into Albon
Brazil last year...
Carlos had one in Brazil
Brazil 2019.
Sainz last year in Brazil. Lewis got a penalty back then aswell.
*laughs in free tv airing here*
"The youngest to ever do so, no less"
Karmas a bitch
um
"Not trying to be snarky, but what/who are you referring to? Neither Ricciardo nor Verstappen are driving a Merc engine."
Yup.
I dont think James will show up in the first race
"> I can sense “Valtteri, it’s James” is coming.

It’s the first race, Mercedes aren’t that kind of team."
"Its the first race of the season, why would merc make a team order to “help” someone in the championship if there are no points scored already?"
Could have been an amazing end part of the race
Hamilton would have caught him quickly either way
"T3 is an easy place to overshoot, it’s better safe than sorry. You don’t want something bad happening on the first race back (or any race for that matter)"
The commentary teams get a team representative assigned to them for the weekend - so it's the same team the whole weekend
"They do reguraly interview Zak Brown from McLaren, Otmar Szafnauer from Racing Point (was about to accidentally type Force India) and Günther Steiner from Haas, too."
I think he got unlucky with this one. He was catching bottas more than half second a lap
he woulda prefered none cause Bottas tyres were dying
"I don't know, he was catching up with Bottas quickly before hand, not sure this is better for him."
He tried to use Charles as leverage to hold that gap but was too far back to follow through.
Against Max last year in Britain he was much worse.
"Okay.
Nice one!
Savage!"
He didn’t have time to catch back up after the safety carlet him unlap himself. He was about 30 seconds behind 15th at the restart.
That Renault literally sounds like a vacuum cleaner.
"As an Asian from around where his flag hails, I'm quite excited to see that happen."
Unless the mercs crash into each other
"And the fact it’s a good race, and the fact it’s F1."
your mum to Mercedes?
*rosberg explosion*
Lmao imagine the scenes
We’re watching too
"That’s what the 1 in F1 means bro. 
1 team"
Kerbs fucked Stroll I think so it's very possibly real
Was my first thought - chassis default 2 1 reminded me of multi - 21 but it looks genuine now!
Happy there is 23 laps left. Lots of time to wreck the car even more!
"Maybe other cars have issues too.

Haven't seen them in half a hour though."
He didn't do anything. It was his spot
He's on Soft tires too... Mercs are both on oooolllld Hards.
Feelsbad
It wasn't. Hamilton was completely steering to the right.
"Not to defend him, but that's an off camber corner that pushes you wide to the left, it's a bit harder to get back to the right, and he already committed to his line, making it more difficult for him to not come into contact"
Imagine if they won lmao
Yes sirrr
With a fucked power unit he might even win—wait did Perez just get a fucking penalty
"Not yet, bottas leclerc Hamilton rn"
3 tenths off
The only reason Mercedes did not have 30 second lead is because of the safety cars. They are still as dominant as ever and once again look unbeatable
Let's not pretend that they weren't 10 seconds up the road without all those safety cars.
"Yea, forget podium. He was in prime position for his first win. No gap, gearbox issues and hards vs a prime car and softs. Poor guy got robbed."
So close yet so far.
For the past 6-7 years yar
"Since 2014 

2014,2015,2016 a lot more dominant
2017,2018 where a little ahead of ferrari
2019 first half was 1-2s everywhere
Second half was a lot more even"
"not this dominant, but yeah"
I'll join you. Just let them fucking race
Doubt they will in the first race but we never know!
F1 is back
He is 100's of miles ahead of the old James Allen days. Those days were excruciatingly awful.
"Do you think he has been told to stay behind, but is just showing that he has the better pace?"
"Well, yeah.  Don’t you know that Lewis is just in the best car and the only reason he’s near the lead right now is because Sebastian is in a ShitBox Ferrari?"
Very different scenarios
"He gave him the space into the corner and took the corner cleanly, gave him all the respect you're supposed to"

Seemed the kneeling was slightly before the anthem? They then got in the circle around the trophies for the anthem.

It's hardly the regulations at fault when Verstappen's engine fails.
And next year’s as well.

"Yup, though I think that strategy would only have switched Ham and Bottas with Hamilton going longer. I still think Bottas's tires will drop off and he'll get him later on the race."
"100% IMO, he didn't leave any room."
Racing incident clearly
If they forget to stay off the kerbs...
This is how we know F1 really is back.
"He had him passed, ham just drove off the corner like a car wasn't there"
"Seriously, he knows he’s there"
"Not that I disagree with the penalty, it was deserved. But look at the onboard replay on lewis’ car, he was on full right lock and didn’t make any changes to his steering to show any intention of driving into Albon. So how was that being dirty? Do tell...."
Thought he was about to go for the knee slide for a moment.
" Bullshit that people didn’t feel comfortable doing it??


Bro. It was clear that they were all raising awareness, just some in different way than others."
Hell they probably could have run it hard enough to keep 1-2. They have trouble at times coming up with strategies for when things go sour.
"cant fuck Bottas that hard, he's fighting Hamilton for WDC"
Bottas hopefully shot that idea down.
Bottas doesn’t have to move over. He wanted to win on track. Simple
No driver is gonna let somebody overtake for the lead even if the other car has penalty. Its just not something Merc can ask for Bottas to do. That would had been disrespectful.
Yes
Yes

Yep

"No, it’s the first race."

Renault’s fault
People need to get used to it. There's going to be an awful lot of it this season.
"I need to catch up, I’ve only watched the first episode of Season 1, I don’t really have a lot of time. Does it get better? Was season 2 any good when they covered Merc in Germany?"
a e r o p a c k a g e
Both Ferraris are - they are firmly midfield now
Forgot about them lmao
Good maybe all the merc engines will explode. Id enjoy that.
And still Vettel can’t overtake ...
At least explains his speed issues.
🤣
"Ferrari and disappointment

Mercedes and 1-2"
Good
"Maybe instead of wasting time complaining how it's unfair that some driver gets paid 40mil, he should actually do his job and perform his worth."
Mate it's not even half way through and three drivers ahead of him have retired... He's gained 3 positions
Lol
Albon with Renault? Excuse me?
RB run honda now
They're Hondas
I don't think they'll do that. Mercedes let Rosberg and Ham race when they fought for the title. They only use team orders when they're racing other teams from what I've seen.
People hate Mercedes and or Hamilton so they automatically call a Mercedes and or Hamilton win boring basically.
Ot's bevause of Merc 1-2. I hate it too but the race is interesting tho
"Agreed, sure Merc 1-2 isn’t fun to see but this is shaping up to be a REALLY good battle for the midfield"
"There's been no fights, just Hamilton overtaking with no problem at all"
"Take my upvote, well played"
:(
"Hardly, Vettel trying to come through from last week and locking up lol"
Lmfao that was all sebs fault...
Insert Wedding Singer “he’s losing his goddamn mind” gif
He locked up a couple of times into turn 3 earlier
Toto: “No”
"Cutting corners is not necessarily faster, which shows."
He's no Ricciardo
They do both things at different points in the race
"When it says ""leader"" at the top it is relative to the first car, ""interval"" and it's to the car in front."
"Look next to the tip driver. It should say either Leader or Gap. 

If it says leader, the time is the total time to the lead car. If it says gap, it's the gap to the car in front!"
it switches betweent the two
It switches between both.
Depends on what stands besides the leader. If it's interval than it's the individual gaps if it is leader than it's to the leader
"if it says ""leader"" at the top, then all times are difference relative to the leader

if it says ""interval"" at the top, then all times are difference relative to the person in front of you"
Distance from leader
You are correc. Sometimes it is from the leader and sometimes the car in front.
They display both. When it is time from the leader it will say leader by the first place driver. When it is time relative to the next driver it will say interval next to the first place driver.
"Check the word next to Bottas’ name on the ranking, if it’s “Leader” the times are relative to Bottas’, if it’s “interval” it’s time between pilots"
Depends on the numbers being shown. Either intervals or gap to the leader.
"They switch between both. You can tell which is which - if the drivers are sitting on +1, +3, +5, +7 then it’s cumulative to P1. If it’s more like +1, +2, +0.5, +1 then it’s to the next driver."
"If at the top of the leaderboars it says ""leader"" then it means that each time shows is how far that driver is behind the leader. When it says ""interval"" that means the time shown is how far behind they are of the driver immediately ahead of them"
"**Leader** means gap to leader, cumulative gap.

~~**Gap**~~ **Interval** means gap from given car to car in front."
"Look at what it says for #1, if it says leader it is from the leader, if it is interval it's the individual intervals from that driver to the one in front"
"If it says leader - then it's the gap to the leader.
If it says gap - then it's the gap between each car."
"They show both, to leader and interval. Edit: I believe it  states which one it is where the leader time would be"
"Check whether it says Leader or Interval at the top. Leader is time to the leader, interval is the time to the car ahead."
"It either shows the time gap to the leader (default) or the gap to the car in front of the driver
.
The graphic says ""interval"" if they switch to that"
"Yea they switch between having times with respect to the first place driver and the driver in front. You can tell this is the case when going down the list will always have a higher number. But they also sometimes switch and show the time with respect to the driver in front, which will be different for every driver, you just have to try to spot the difference. By default on the list it’s against leader though."
He will just go from finishing this one to fp1 next week.
T2 to pay homage to the 2016 race
It's just encoded messages for Multi21
I think the Ferrari is better in corners but 3 straights in a row are probably killing it.
if merc hold this on old tyres with no curbs that pretty much seals it anyway!
"Both drivers. ""I wish someone had said something earlier"""
LMAO
Not to the wheel itself. The wheel nut had an issue and the wheel itself came off not the hub/brake assembly
Don’t think so
It's extremely rare that debris is on the main strait and they need to go through there
he really thought it out
Because the tractor is on the main straight to retrieve the car
Tractor on the straight to recover Kimi car
Tractor on track
Car stopped on main straight
To let the marshalls recover Kimi's car
Debris on the start-finish straight
because the hazard is on the main straight
They need to clear the car from the track so they move there in order to not cause an injury obstruction or danger to the marshals.
Kimi’s car is on the straight
The recovery vehicle was blocking the track at the start/finish straight.
Broken car and crane on race straight
"Kimo's car was stuck on the main straight, needed to get heavy equipment onto the track to remove it. Safer for all to go through pits"
There's stuff they need to clear on the straight so they go through the pit for safety
Because Kimi's car is on the pit straight so it's safer to send the cars through the pits while they clear the track.
"Recovering kimi's vehicle which is on the start-finish straight, safer to drive through the pits and give the recovery crew the space to recover safely"
The cars have been on blocks for months.
Yeah but this isn't like the rest of the first race of the year
First race in an unusual place?

"Yeah, it’s not like Hamilton is getting the same message or anything."
My first thought lmao
Maybe he could have.... changed his steering angle?
"Which is why they collided. If I spear you, I didn't change my steering angle at all either."
Which means he drove straight into Albon... He was on the edge of the track ahead of Lewis
"He honestly could have just slowed down and turned in a bit more, considering his line was forcing Albon off the track"
"But his angle was such that he was drifting out to the racing line, while another car was on that line and ahead of him."
He needed to leave more room for albon...
You can't take the normal line when a car is besides you. That is not a difficult concept. When you go side by side you have to adapt.
Because mercs make good gearboxes
How about nobody?

I like your flair. :D
"from hamilton onboard, he could not avoid contact unless the redbull stayed out wide. 

its is contact caused by hamilton but there was nothing he could do to avoid it from the moment he turned in."
Not really. Lewis wasn't paying attention to a car that got ahead of him and ran wide. Not a racing incident.
Rule says you are to leave a car's width. That's the same penalty HAM benefitted from in the Canadian GP a few years back.
Yes they need to do this ASAP
Actually could have been a good move on a street track
Ooooo that’s good
Oof
No.
I take it you weren't around in 2002?

They're heating them up
"Tyre blankets to help them get to temperature. They are stopping using them either next year or 2022, can't remember which"

Those are heat covers. It’s to keep the tires warm while the car is stationary
flexible electric heaters.  Makes sure the tyres are hot before they go out.
They are tire warmers to try and keep temperature in the tyres
tyre warmers - leave them on as long as possible
They are tyre blankets that keep the tyres warm so they don't need as long to warm up when going out to race
they do that in a lot of motorsports

"Yup. Tyres are pre heated to around 90% of their working temperature

happen to merc when hami-senpai engine overheated
"If this is making hate issues, the Spanish go in August is going to look like a battle royale"
Track temperature would be much higher
Isn't it technically a high altitude track though too? Thinner air reduces cooling efficiency.
"No heat related issues as far as cooling goes. This is almost never an issue apart from maybe Mexico where the track is 2+km above sea level and the air is thin.

What might prove an issue is that the free practices and qualifying where you set up and the car, and more importantly get used to tyre degradation was run at much lower temperatures. At today's race the track temperature is 2.5 times (in Celsius!) what it was in the free practice, so the tyre behavior that they got used to is pretty much useless"
Might've been Austria 2018 actually.
Dutch television mentioned that for Hamilton it was like 33 races ago or something like that
Brazil 2019?
"Hamilton 33 races ago on the same track, according to Dutch commentators."
I think when they were invading russia
Great point
Race? The season is over as far as I'm concerned.
um the australian race is summer? which is the first race of the year
Yes. We don't know exactly what it is yet.
Yeah seems to based on a clip of the comms that they played
Yes! Team radio mentioned they’d looking into it
No
Nope
Nope
"Almost, except for Hamilton wrecking him"
Nope not in F1
Nope. Just missed out on Brazil last year after getting spun by Hamilton.
Not in F1
No
"No. Would have been last year but Hamilton drove into him. Hamilton took full blame, apologised and got penalty."
"no, this would be his first, if his car survives"
No. He was due for it last year in Brazil but Hamilton spun him out on the second to last lap.
Are we watching the same race?
Retired due to mechanical issue
PU issues. I heard something about anti stall. Should've retired in the 12th lap.
Yeah but much closer than last year. Baby steps.
Nice
Generous.
They still need good drivers. Higher placed = more prize money.
"Isn't he a paid driver? Redbull may be rich, but free money is free money.

Also, he's banging Piquets daughter"
Plan F to pay respects.....to everyone else's engines
F
The gap is increasing. It will vary but the general trend is increasing.
Gap seems stable for quite w few laps now
"He is driving a Mercedes, Albon is not."
A car that is a second a lap faster and has been for a 6 years.
Best Driver + Best Car = fast
In a shorter season it means that the most reliable car wins instead of the fastest. I prefer the fastest to win.
He’s just an inferior driver
very much looks like it
That's what happens when you can't test as much but have to keep developing your cars
Williams train coming through. Choo Choo.
I'm not so sure that's his issue today. I think he has an issue on the car and Mercedes are clearly worried about reliability.
Mechanical issues for both

"2.5 sec for Hamilton, 2.8 for Bottas."
"Graphic showed 2.5 for Ham, 2.8 for Bot"
Probably unless he does a Perez and stretches the tyres out which he has the potential to do but I don't see why they've done that
Looks like a brake failure
Either terrible driving or brake failure. Looked more like brake failure.
Brake failure.
Brake disc failure
Looked like front brakes didn't engage.
Front brake failure
poss right front brake failure according to the commentators
Break failure
They wait for it to close up anyway
You have to maintain a certain speed.
"As soon as the SC is deployed there is a minimum lap time they have to adhere to, so they all have to slow down"
are we expecting 2 stops or is everyone going to the end with these tyres?
Lewis was behind. It's a shockingly good predictor
"to stir the pot, are you new here?"
Berndt wanted to stretch his legs.
Marshalls and heavy equipment at trackside recovering a car.
Gotta keep the SC out for +5 laps to annoy us even if it's only required for half lap.
Yep
"The initial yellow, yes. Now that the SC is out it basically turns into a full course yellow even after the hazard is cleared away."
Yeah I knoww.. :(
at least it's only a williams and gio in front
"Should be okay since he did not go in the fast lane

Edit: they're looking into it now"
Gearbox problems
"Everyone but Magnussen got power problems, independantly"
"Overheating, Ted just said"
Cooling the car
"Nah, let the mercs fight."
We just need Albon and someone else to retire : )
DAS is very good at warming the tires lol
"I mean, if he got the overtake we'd all be saying he's a genius"
i would hope that its racing that make its interesting. Winning by someone elses DNF is just not that satisfying.
For what? The pit release? If anything that would probably just be a team fine.
"If another car has a brake failure or a lockup, they're smashing straight into his car"
Someone could have gone off the track there and smashed into him
Probably in case someone else had an off at the same place and collided with his stricken car
"If a crash occurs going into that corner, KMag is a sitting duck. Could be catastrophic"
"The Haas was in the run off area, if another car spun out in that corner he could have crashed into the Haas."
"They have to get the car out of the area, and if the folks still in the race are going hard at it, the same thing could happen again and send a car crashing into the car recovery folks. It caused a death in the past."
"Because T3 is a big overtaking spot, and it's hard to clear a car away from there. Don't want to risk someone piling into the HAAS sat there."
"If they were clearing the car behind the barriers in that position, the workers would be exposed to another car coming straight at them like Kmag did."
If they are on the track at all then it comes out so they can remove the car. Don’t want anyone spinning out trying to race and crashing into everyone.
Because Mercs are so dominant the last years that only by using cheap tricks like SC for no reason can spice up these boring races.
"The problem is that the car was at the end of an area that is bound to get other cars going through if they have an issue. Basically, it's to prevent another accident happening in the same location while there is a tow truck or marshals recovering the previous car."
"From what I understand, it was in a turn where the cars are coming through fast, and it will be dangerous to the marshals recovering the car if they are going at speed (even with yellow flags). Recovering under the safety car will make all the cars slow down and compact the train, so there is more window for the marshals to recover the car safely."
"He was in the run off area.  So say someone else had a brake failure like him, going full speed up to turn 1 whilst they where removing the car from the track there is a risk of cars flying straight into them."
"More than likely due to it being on the straight. Area outside the track has pits that will slow a car before hitting the wall. Going off track at 200 mph and hitting another car wouldn’t be fun.     
Also they generally have a crane lift the car over the wall to get it off track and that requires people to be there. Don’t want someone sliding off track and hitting them."
Because if another driver goes off in the same place they'll crash into the stationary car
"You're right that the car was clear of the track, however it was still in the runoff area. It probably is unlikely, but if they race on full speed someone else might have a similar problem to Magnussen and crash into his car or worse a marshal / rescue vehicle.  

F1 also has a bit of a stigma here, because the last death of a F1 driver was because he crashed into a rescue vehicle which was taking care of another crashed car.  

So better safe than very sorry i'd say."
Just poor race pace and medium performance compared to RP
"That Ferrari really is dreadful.

That said, after all of Seb's major 2019 cock-ups (Britain & Italy) ended with redemption in the next race...."
It just means that they're looking into it. But apparently no further action.
Probably struggling but he's the best at tyre management on the grid
Team orders to hold position
Austria 2016
"It flashes when the ERS battery is harvesting instead of being used for power. It warns cars behind that the car in front might be a touch slower than they would expect if the ERS was being used.

Edit: Oh it also flashes in wet weather but that isn't relevant to this race"
"It means they’re ‘harvesting’ for the hybrid system. The electronic part of the drive system harvests kinetic and heat energy from the propshafts and brakes, which means cars can slow more quickly. It’s just a heads up to the drivers behind."
Probably a little of both.
Merc are just too good.
It symbolizes how far they are from 1st
Hopefully in the bin
DON'T REMIND THEM.
Please don't fuckin tempt them
Yeah! Gimme those accurate tyre life graphics
They switch between the two
Depends. If it says leader its time to race leader. If it says interval its between places
The leader in this case
When it says leader at the top then times are set to distance from the leader. Interval means the time gap to car in front of that driver.
"It depends, sometimes they show different ones. You can generally tell using math."
"It changes, but on Sky atm its leader"
"Sometimes one. Sometimes the other. 

You can tell by seeing if the times all go up. Or if they go up and down."
They have both: It shows 'Leader' next to 1st placed driver if the gaps are to first place and it shows 'Interval' if its the gaps between the individual drivers.
Leader
I’ve been confused too.
"Each other, typically. Usually you can tell if the times go up in a ascending order, then its by leader, if it looks random its each other"
From each other atm. It swaps every so often from gap to leader and car in front
From the leader
"Depends, sometimes it's from leader, sometimes it's between each driver.

Easy to tell if the times get increasingly bigger it's from the leader.  Rather than delta between the drivers."
"It switches around. Take a loot at the field next to P1, it either says ""Leader"" (gap to 1st) or ""Interval"" (gap to driver in front)."
If they are all increasing then it is from the leader. If they are all variable then it is from the driver in front of them.
The difference is from the person ahead of them. It's usually a good indicator for battles or potential overtakes.
Apparently not unsafe enough
No penalty *Yet
Stupid
seems odd as it was a textbook definition of it
No decision yet. It's been acknowledged as an incident tho
Williams didn’t double stack so unfortunately as RUS was in front he was put to the back since it was a safety car.
"It looks like it, he lost 10 seconds just after the safety car came in but otherwise the lap times haven't been that far off Grosjean ahead"
"""Tao-ry"" is correct. It's not Tauri like Taurus, if that makes sense"
towery? yeah
He's usually extremely good at it but will it be enough?
"It's all dirty air, it's just it makes you faster when you get close enough"
Around 1 or 2 seconds behind the lead car.
"In a corner? Dirty air. 

On a straight? Slipstream"
in the corners
It‘s good on straights and bad in corners
"In the corners. On straights, slipstreaming is preferable, as it reduces drag. In corners, slipstreaming turns into a disadvantage, as the disturbed air doesnt create full downforce on the aerodynamic surfaces, reducing cornering grip."
What a bold prediction of you
He deserves it after Brazil last year!
PRAY HARDER
But we wouldn’t want to see that would we. Let’s just keep those cameras planted firmly on the mercs 👍🏻
Maybe useless in fast lap.
They did behind the safety car. They don’t need to generate heat while racing full speed.
"Hamilton is, just not overtaking"

That subs dead. Ill pm you the new page

Leading F1.5
Yes.
yeah.  They've broken suspensions in the past few years
"yes, the curbs are very agressive. also the ideal line is on these huge curbs for most of the corners. also the corners are very fast. a real beating for the cars"
Led him for 51 laps so far so can't be too bad.
In 2021 the Renault Scenic route?..
I need him to get a podium.... I need it...
You had to jinx it :(((
...if your car breaks then it you hardly get the luxury of choosing exactly where you stop.
End me
I hate that you are probably right... lol
Of course.
Decent call I think. Only 20 laps left and they have more pace
They accidentally got their nascar designers to design them
"Austria is brutal on the cars due to the monster kerbs and high track temps, I guess normally they have had a few thousand KM’s of running beforehand!"
The red and white curbs at this rate.
In b4 a Toro Rosso loses both wheels
How much did you bet?
Looking like a bunch of wankers
They looked great in 2018 and should have finished in 4th were it not for some stupid mistakes on part of the team (Australia’s the first thing that comes to mind)
It's so frustrating how they've actually gotten worse
"I can't see them staying in F1, it's just been downhill for years and there's no hope that anything's going to get better.

I couldn't believe they kept both of these drivers, it's a slow car but clearly KMag and Grosjean aren't going to bring anything to benefit the team."
No
"If both Mercedes gearboxes fail yes, otherwise no."
"He didn’t pit, so probably not"
He didn't on his first stop.
Might be tyre allocation?
they are fast enough on used hards... why risk it?
"track position, the others were only 10 seconds behind."
Exactly. Not like they weren't driving away even with the engine turned down
Don't dnt wanna lose track position cuz they don't have pace to overtake with the chasis problems
"Losing places. They can easily survive until the end, no point in risking it."
"Losing track position, the SC came out after they first past the pit lane, meanwhile albon was the first one who happened to catch the timings right."
Imagine if Vettel finishes 11/11...
"It's tethered through the suspension to hold on during a crash, but here the wheel just came off like in a pitstop"
"I think their on the wheel drum, whereas the whole tyre came off rather than the drum as well"
I'd just like to the make the point that is not normal.
That'll be a big bit. Huge gap between testing and 1st race.
That plus the aggressive kerbs
He’s going to get back to p8 if this continues lol
Mechanical issue of some sort. Brought out safety car #2
Track position
They are on hards
"Guess they think they have the pace to keep ahead even on old hards, a pitstop is always a risk, especially a double stack"
I straight forgot he was in the race. Legit thought he retired.
Autozone lol
please don't jinx it with your flair... Please don't
Leclerc with a bird flying into the intake
one of merc for sure
Double DNF from Merc 🤞
The tether is on the suspension/brake not the wheel.
The track
Whoever is in the safety car lmao
Bernd Maylander
Safety Car
Last one standing
The tether doesn't connect to the wheel directly but to the part that holds the wheel
"Because it is fixed to the wheel fixing assembly thing, not to the rotating tire itself"
Tethers are for the suspensions. The wheel just fell off the rim
"That only helps with suspension failures, obviously the tyres itself have to be outside of that system for pit stops."
The tethers attach to the wheels rather than tyres. His tyre wasn't secured properly rather than the entire wheel coming off.
Only 2 more and Latifi will have a point
Hopefully both Mercedes.
Both mercs. Just imagine
"Wheel wasn't attached properly, he pitted during the Russel SC :("
"I've had it with this place!  We got no jobs, we got no food, *our cars' tyres keep fallin' off!!!*"
The front fell off....
"Well you see the tire fell off. They aren’t supposed to do that, but it did."
He took his pit stop in the Haas garage
UNSUBSCRIBE
Awkward
What?
OMFG WHAT A RACE
"Are u mad lmaooooo, that was hamiltons fault hahah"
RIP
Woohoo! There is light at the end of this tunnel
We are playing the long con here
Maldonado and anyone.
Hamilton and the pussycat doll chick
"There's always next year,   o wait that slogan is already taken"
Noooo
I sorta hope
like space hoppers
He has it with the penalty right now
There you go...
He's second with the HAM penalty
Ham understeered into him from a behind position...
"Winning in a shit car because of crashes, penalties and mechanical failures"
Driver of the day in that POS
Bottas doesn't have to go much further
We can dream
THIS IS THE LANDO IVE BEEN WAITING FOR! JUST FUCKIN GOING FOR IT!
"Leave enough space when the guy is next to you, that is how racing works."
I think Lewis would benefit from a safety car tho
"As soon as Leclerc got P4 I knew it was over, that 5 second on Hamilton gave me hope but then he got a penalty of his own :("
It literally makes no sense
ANOTHER ONE.
points for williams woo woo
YES LANDO
Just not the Williams lol
Nope his fastest lap just secured him 3rd!
No he’s on it.
HE WON'T
pOg
It's there by their little makeshift podium.
"Might be coming, it’s always after the just out of the car interview"
Just the name so far.
"ocon, gio and russel are pretty close too"
Stroll 2.0
"Albon was ahead, Lewis didn't have the right to the line and should have been aware Albon was there."
Karma for what?
Why karma?
Maybe they should protest to the FIA about their unreliable car.
👊🏾
yeah because Hamilton is the only one who benefits from Max having issues
Cuz it wasn't...
"It's perfectly legal for a driver to take a tire from the wall and fit it to their own car, the problem is that the jack is stored under the engine and it's very hot in there."
What speakers are those?
"Nice one, Bernie"
He tried to pull something away from him?
"Didn't think about it that way, but it's pretty true."
I'd say they are like Real Madrid from 2003 to 2009
That’s very unsporting of you.
Yes because there’s nothing else to watch
GIO up 6 places....
That's mean :(
this is his chance!
 They need to pray for a miracle...
Who didnt take it?
"He seems like a pretty mellow guy to me. He started that he would take a knee as a statement against racism, not necessarily in support of BLM."
Austria 2002 nightmares intensify
"Teams that develop everything themselves:  
  
* Red Bull 
* Ferrari 
* Renault 
* Mercedes 
* Williams 
  
Pick your poison :("
they’re talking about the engine
Amen bro. We can only hope
?
Except the 5 meters on the inside
Robbed by Lewis again
"They are, yep"
"Yeah they're with two teams this week, McLaren and one more (can't remember who...)."
McLaren and Red bull I think. read it a few days ago during fp1
They are filming. Have been spotted this weekend at some garage I can't remember
"Yes, can't remember which teams they are embedded with though."
"I'm also having issues with F1 TV.. half the time the page doesn't load and when it finally does, it just hangs on ""initializing""... very frustrating"
"Could be something agreed on during the driver’s meeting, but I think stewards are generally more lenient towards track limits during lap 1."
This is not the way I wanted Norris to get a podium...
"When was their last championship? How much do they spend per year, are they there as a car manufacturer? How many of their issues have been Renault/Honda over the years?

Seriously, you can't see the difference."
Listen back at Max's boardradio it sounds more like software problems.
It honestly sounds more electronic than mechanical failure
Disappointment? Oh yeah every race
Does what happen?
With Honda and Renault engines yes
Yes unfortunately
"For different reasons, but yeah"
"It's certainly a thing that can happen, but I wouldn't say it happens with regularity anymore."
No - shouldn’t happen at all. It’s more heartbreaking because it’s Red Bull’s home race and they challenged a decision by the FIA which resulted in VER being 2nd by pushing HAM back.
"Today’s was especially bitter because it was purely mechanical error, for a driver who’s actually had a very decent chance to make the race competitive. 

Lots of drivers will have car issues but that will usually happen throughout the midpack, rarely one of the top 3 drivers."
"Breakdowns? Breakdowns of one sort or another have always been commonplace, however reliability has gone up a lot in the last 20/25 years. Electronics fucking up so badly is relatively rare but it happens, last year Vettel's car lost all electrics once."
Ferrari fans are eternal optimists
"Modern problems require 🅱️inotto solutions.
It can't explode if it barely starts."
Ferrari says yes
As long as the earth spins so will Grosjean.
So was Bottas yesterday.
"Yeah but Kevin only spun *because* of Romain, he’s the real vanker here"
100%
Maybe he accidentally stepped into the safety car this morning.
*dragon turtle noises intensify*  RAAAAWWWWWRGGGHHHH!
Both
It's Latifi's first race in his first season of F1.
Yes.
Russel had a full season to get used to the car shaningans.
Both
"Little column A, little column B."
You think he is really done?
You realise it was like 40c here last year and 30 ish this year. Being significantly cooler helps a lot.
Old mediums doubtful
Everybody out of form.
Gotta shake off the off-season rust. Mechanics don't expect X to happen and then shit hits the fan
Nah that was the whole wheel. Looked like it either wasn’t attached properly or something broke.
It came off all in one piece though so it will be on the team for not ensuring the wheels are on securely.
The whole wheel plus tyre came off.
bit optimistic thinking all are going to finish isn't it.
Germany last year? There were even less iirc
Germany maybe?
No idea about 13 but we're close to Monaco 1998.
Poor pit crew installation probably
he got approval fromrace control
"He had the position, I think, though haven't seen a good replay yet. Perez zoomed past again after yellow flag came out"
"He had the place before the safety car, Perez retook it about the same time the safety came in. Albon has been given the spot back."
He got told to take it back by race control as he was ahead when the safety car came out.
Looks like a racing incident to me.
"Honestly, could go either way."
Racing incident in all honesty
Looked like Hamilton
"Lewis, Albon was ahead"
"I love both. That's on Hamilton, Albon had the position."
"It'll be debated hot and heavy here, but we don't know yet."
"Albon was a bit brave, but he was ahead of Hamilton, so Hamilton's fault"
Racing incident if you ask me.
"The car in the lead typically has the right-of-way, so that may be a penalty for Hamilton. Depends on other factors, such as whether they think Hamilton moved into Albon or if he had space to not move into him."
"Depends if HAM moved from his race line, but it looks like a mistake from Albon."
Pretty sure it was hamilton since he under steered into Albon.
"Welcome to formula 1! :)

That crash is on Hamilton. Albon was faster and Hamilton pulled over on Albons line."
Wasnt he ahead tho.Might as well stay at home if you dont go for that
He really wants a podium and the pressure is causing anxious decisions
Leclerc looking good for a podium.
Meanwhile Seb isn't scoring points
Care to explain? Im on dutch commentary i'd love to hear.
Hell no
Nope no one has any clue who is winning or what position.
"No, it's not. More cars typically finish, though Mercedes does normally run off and leave everybody though."
This race was on meth
"Charles got P2 because of consistency, not pace. The car still sucks. And why Lewis? It wasn't a huge mistake from him."
Leading BRIT
"He said “isn’t the leading Brit,” not driver."
I believe he said He isn’t the leading British driver since 2014
Of U.K. drivers. That’s what he was talking about. Might be overall
I think he said he's not the leading Brit in the standings for the first time since then
Leading Brit!
"Since it's wrong. Vettel and Bottas usually started pretty well the past few years then Hamilton really ran home the rest of the season.

Last time Hamilton won the first race of the season was 2015."
"The whole WeRaceAsOne initiative is really great to see, but seeing the actual rainbow rather than the team colours rainbow on the McLaren does feel good."
[deleted]
"Not a pride flag, sadly :( It's for the \#WeRaceAsOne initiative they're doing to increase diversity; they made the rainbow by using the colors of each team to show that all the teams are working towards that goal"
Yeah it looks great imo.
"Doesn't apply to me, but I'm no less happy to see it."
I’m not LGBTQ but I think it looks dope
I like the design of it. Fits so perfectly.
This. It will come along as he gets more experience.
"“No, I don’t think I will”"
they should have waited until Norris was past their box...
"It's unsafe to go out into another racer like that. They had to do it because if he did get ahead of Norris that could very well clinch 4th place or better for RP. 

Sportsmanship is well and good but you have to be a bit cutthroat to compete"
"It's unsafe to go out into another racer like that. They had to do it because if he did get ahead of Norris that could very well clinch 4th place or better for RP.

4 time WDC is elite regardless of current form
"It isn't his fault, Russell is clearly in a superior car..."
Interesting tactics
"I love him, but I absolutely agree.

Norris podium please."
Ran Albon off the road.
"Someone from Mercedes

Edit: Holly Chapman, Power Unit engineer of Valtteri Bottas"

"It's not about ending racism with one gesture, it's about making enough small efforts to eventually end racism. Standing/kneeling is one of those actions"
Any issue not usually brought up would feel forced.the whole point is awareness raising
Feeling forced > pretending like it doesn't exist
No he wasn't the wheel was only turned 90 degress. He could've avoided it but chose not to because that would mean slowing down and giving the position to Albon.
Lol
That's was funny not boring
Same old F1
Boring? I am done with these ungrateful fans!
? Been decent
"Agreed, this is now a pattern and should be treated as such"
Yeah agree 100% -  he intentionally steered into Albon again
Try getting rid of some bias.
never
Will you be tuning out too? People who make comments like this about switching off have a weird habit of continuing to comment.
What???
"In a real unique situation though where they're back here again next weekend, gonna be interesting to see how big a factor that has as the season goes on."
"Merc has been doing this for years, but remember FIA totally has a Ferrari bias."
That used to be possible but I think it's illegal now.
Last years rookies are exciting tho
Really? Renault might not let him finish the season?
"by that logic Hamilton is 5 seconds behind bottas, must be a shitty driver (not that Latifi is that good of a driver)"
Dangerous location where the Haas is parked...avoid a Jules Bianchi type accident most importantly.
While the Marshalls get the car off track.
its directly in the runoff area so its dangerous to retrieve
Car is directly in a run off area. Would be dangerous to keep racing with a car there like that just in case another car goes off.
"I think they were saying he is right where you would go if you crashed at turn 3, and as its a popular overtaking point thats quite likely to happen"
"If 1 car can end up there at speed, another can easily and do harm. You wouldn't want marshals on track in the braking zone of a corner with cars going at speed"
"crash line,"
Car needs to be pulled off. Standard procedure since the Bianchi incident
They need to remove the car. It's too dangerous if another car goes of at the same spot which is highly likely there.
I don't think Volvo's are that reliable nowadays though lol.
No way he'll make it to the end on softs
He would hace changed to hards to go to the end
If Landon didn’t have to slow then they’ll probably just get a warning
Whut 🙄
Didn't change much. Perez was already faster before SC and more grip with softer tyre after restart made it easier to overtake.
Safety car is necessary. Obviously McLaren is having troubles with warming up their tyres. Not the safety cars fault...
"Haas cars are a joke. One retired with a faulty brake, after gaining 3 places in the start and keeping faster cars behind him for 20+ laps."
"He he goes normal speed into Sainz and gets a DNF or brakes as hard as he can, loses speed by skidding, and just spins keeping him in the race. Sainz locked up into the corner and went into Vettels line. Racing incident, but Vettel handled that well."
Albon isn't in a Mercedes
The wheel came off the car. It wasn't bolted on. Nothing to do with the area where the tethers are.
Let’s hope so
They haven't been driving on the limit because of the SC. It might not be critical anymore.
The wheel went too
"No, the whole wheel was off, could see the hub"
Amateurish from Albon. He was too close there with too little space. Should have been more patient. The place was there for the taking. He just needed to be more patient.
"Double mercedes dnf, Perez win and Latifi point I beg"
"How quick you judge, the fourth point is still open...

Edit: and as I write this Hamilton got a 5 second penalty..."
"Haha its not like this is new, but i still find myself thinking about the exact same thing time and time again."
Did you really expect LH not to get a time penalty for that?
"Albon deserves that 2nd spot on the podium, so upsetting"
Lol he didn't clear him out he's on full lock
Didn’t throw away his shot
"The cars infront of him slowed soo much. Vettel braked where he normally would have with the correct speed, but suddenly Norris - really slow, Vettel had to change his corner aproach angle, thus his speed is now too much for that corner/steering angle."
"and next year too.

its gonna be like 2 years till we have a real shot at some competition."
[deleted]
So true!! First race of the season and people are already complaining. So frustrating. I'm just happy to see some live racing
HAHAHAHA sike
Because Hamilton's vector is going off track. He goes sideways into Albon
Unfortunately Albon turned in to early.
So that people don't run wide to gain time advantage. Forces you to stay on track or risk damage to your car
"The kerbs are there to give the drivers feedback on how close they are to the track limits, if they were to not have bumps why not just make the tarmac wider instead of bumpless kerbs?"
45 seconds back with no spins is bonkers
"Albon was ahead, Lewis didn't have the right to the line and should have been aware Albon was there. You don't back out when you're already ahead. Lewis touched his back wheel."
You have
No
🙄
"He was passed and did not give way, instead his pointed his car at Albon. You HAmilton stans are incredible."
That. WAS an opportunity. He overtook on the outside and had the preferred line on corner exit. HAM had the position before the corner so he felt he could still force Albion off the track even if Alex was half a car ahead on the outside.
He tried to force him off the track and has the nerve to raise his hand like he didn’t do anything lmfao
12 laps into race #1 lmao
Did anyone really expect anything else?
Hahahahaha
Could have got 66/1 on that
:(
"On the mediums and is just behind Leclerc, that is okay."
"Too right mate, couldn't happen to a nicer chap."
"Don't say that, they could do it"
"hope of what, imberb?

Why would you want a lesser person win?

We are not getting the right person to win because of RBR crybabies. But I cursed them and they paid the price. And they will more in the future."
Don't count out Bottas.
"I mean Bottas has a....... nah, i can't finish it"
"Seems so, everything stopped working"
It went into anti stall and would not drive.
"Car was stuck in anti-stall, whatever that means."
"Probably not - the time taken to swap the wing might not be worth it?

Only if it gets damaged I imagine"
I don’t think they will risk it
I don’t think they will risk it
It's unlikely they would do that as wing changes take about 5-6 seconds in the box
That would add like 15 secs to his pit. No way.
I mean if thats because you chose anything to do with Renault thats on you
Yeah if either one of them gets the podium I’ll be happy
"Lol same, but don’t rule bottas out, if that makes it better anyway"
You still have Latifi 😂
His career in a nutshell
I wonder why Williams didn’t try to double stack. Now he’s last but otherwise he’s doing well all things considered.
Not a single overtake on Merrit huh?
I'd cum
Albon for the win!
I think Ferrari are done with his spins
likely and i like it
He hadn't fully unlapped himself when the race resumed.
He was a lap back just before the restart
f1 isnt pay to win :)
"Max - Engine becuase engis told him to change stuff, so electrical?

As expected, 3rd.

> stroll - why did he retire?

Sensor issues."
"Max's car stalled. 

Lando and Carlos had a pretty horrible start to the race dropping off a little, but it seems like they're better on the mediums than the softs.

Albon's doing fine.

Engine issues and steady from the start for all 4 questions.
"Max seems to have turned his car off by accident (yes really)

Lando has held up well but slightly less good than in qualifying. Still a step up for McLaren since last year.

Albon is doing well, pulling out from the cars behind him comfortably.

Stroll had a sensor issue which resulted in a power unit problem."
"Max - Engine issues

Lando - Been racing pretty good.  Consistently 4th.  Except just now with Perez passing him with the faster tyres. 

Albon - Consistently 3rd.

Stroll - Engine issues."
"Max and Lance both had their engine go boom

Lando was good, lost out to Albon and Hamilton after some 5 laps, now lost out to Perez too. Lando is 5th

Albon started amazingly, held off Hamilton, was overtaken after like 10 laps. He is 3rd atm and surely will get his maiden podium

Also, Seb spun again"
"Max had engine failure or something failure on his car, it wouldn't go

Lando seems pretty good so far, but he started P3 so it isn't the best

Stroll had an engine or technical failure I don't remember"

4 how?
Safety > being fair
I feel like they dont really care if the safety car is fair or not. Safety goes first.
"It''s not supposed to be fair, it's for SAFETY"
"No, there is no limit. There already were races with 6-7 safety cars and/or with ~80% of laps behind the SC"
"There's no limit, and yes it's ""not fair"" for the leader. That's why there's a virtual safety car nowadays but for some reason it hasn't been used today."
He didnt pit
There was an Australian GP which had about 14 retirements back in the mid-2000s.
Australia 2008 ended with 6 cars iirc
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Monaco_Grand_Prix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Monaco_Grand_Prix)
Probably Monaco 1996. Only 3 crosstthe line
1996 Monaco maybe. 18 retirements
"Monaco 96 had five cars take the finish flag iirc. Edit: three cars, of 22 starting"
2005 USGP?  6 finishers at the end.
Does 2005 usa count? 6 finishers
"The percentage of cars may be the most relevant, but it's 85.7%, 1996 Monaco grand prix"
Nowhere near
Does 2005 Indy GP count?
1996 Monaco in the modern era. 18 of 21 starting cars retired.
"Yup, Albon time."
That was so bad can't describe it and he will get away with it
"I like Leclerc, ferrari sucks tho."
Inb4 he puts 6 seconds on Bottas
"looked like he left more space that many overtakes, but was also full lock and understeered slightly. Albon got greedy thinking it was his only shot at passing him."
Lolololo llora
Yes
"He stopped turning left to make his front wheel hit Albon's back wheel. It was ever so slightly, but the cockpit cam shows it."
">a

that nikka is a joke"
"More likely 1&3 but yeah should have made the call when they got the penalty, going to be a tense garage."
Another fan of Chaos I see
You can't wait with the Mercedes though
:(
"That's me.

Racers are superstitious.

This will be considered."
I think this might be the dumbest thing I’ve heard in a while.
I dont understand how he is still in F1
Absolutely shit show in the last two years. Especially at pit stops.
"Lol hotstar streaming F1 race in 24fps at 720p is eye cancer. Fucking would've chucked their subscription if nto for the tennis Grand Slams

Check your pm I'll send a quality stream"
Yes... I don't know either...
"Clear, not quicker"
They might as well be tbf
My condolences
Cause it's not his fault Haas can't make brakes.
He had no brakes
It was wrongly changed
It's attached to the wheel - the tyre came off but the wheel was still on
The tether is part of the suspension
it was the tire that flew off of the rim I think
"I believe that cord is attached to the suspension, in case the suspension breaks. They don’t cover cases where the tire isn’t screwed in correctly."
"The tether is in the hub, the tyre likely wasn't secured to the hub properly in the pit stop."
Hamilton u slut
And with DRS activated next lap he would've had it...
Maybe all the other teams should quadruple their budget to compete
"Classic talk every ""too big to fail"" team in every sport. It's easy just work harder looool"
Because this shit sucks from a fans point of view. It's been years and years of watching merc dominate.
Preach
That’s why almost everybody is shitting on Ferrari here
"Just pull yourself up by your bootstraps /s

It's clear that Mercedes is impossible to beat for abyone else"
The fact that Norris doesn't punt Leclerc off the next lap says otherwise.
"Hamilton drifted out wide when albon was already there.

You can't take the racing line when someone's already in it"
Albon was in front.
"That protest was a correct protest by the result of it. So cant fault RBR for that, Ferrari was next in line to protest too."
"I disagree, Albon was alongside or ahead the entire way through the corner, it was his corner and Hamilton squeezed him. 

If anything he got off easy with 5 seconds.

Gutted for Albon but stoked for Lando"
Why is the penalty bullshit? Hamilton just straight up forced Albon off the track when Albon managed to pass him
Hamilton hasn't even passed Albon yet
Or take each other out.
Makes it vaguely more interesting if nothing else
"Yep, if another car had a similar issue that car was in the 'firing line'. Could have been a terrible incident."
"Yeah, I would've reckoned a VSC would have achieved the same. MAG was far enough away from the track in my eyes"
Yeah another car could do the exact thing he did without a spin and go straight into the first car
Big braking zone and he's right in the way
Yes. Say the next lap the same thing happened to Grosjean. We could have casualties.
It makes races F1 starts fun again
"Car on the runoff needing a crane to be removed, that's regulation SC especially after Bianchi"
"Last time they went with a virtual car when a car was stuck in a runoff zone, a French driver died, so yeah..."
A stuck car at the end of one of the biggest braking zones? I think so.
"Yes, the Haas was directly in the runoff area so if another car was to go off, they'd potentially impact the Haas"
"Wheel to wheel racing has always been a weak point for him. 
He won his 4 championships by getting pole and a Saturday and driving away on a Sunday."
I think the pressure and expectations got to him
Why?
They would still find a way... Mercedes finds a way
It's attatched to the suspension. The wheel nut seems to have failed.
"The tethers attach to the wheel rim, not to the tyre itself."
"Those work if the suspension breaks, that didn't happen in this case"
No it looks like it wasnt secured properly so they werent tethered to it or engaged
"The rope holds the whole assembly in case it breaks off, if the tire isn't put on properly there's nothing to hold it."
No looks like the wheel wasn’t bolted on properly. The cable that attaches the ‘wheel’ actually only connects the wheel pod
That's to keep the entire braking and suspension components coming off. That was just the wheel coming off. Only thing holding the wheel/tire to the suspension is the wheel nut.
No the wheel came off the hub like in pitstop. Tethers only work it the wheel is attached to the hub
That prevents the whole hub from flying off. Only the big chonka bolt holds the wheel to the hub.
The tether is in the wheel hub. Only the  wheel came off in this incident.
"Nope, the tether failed somehow"
Patience... He was already past Hamilton???? Hamilton made contact with Albons rear wheel...
Yes it was a dumb manoeuvre by Albon. But if someone else is stupid it doesn’t mean you can do something illegal.
"It does at times. I prefer the G meter, helps appreciate how incredible the cars and drivers are."
I mean some retierments and mistakes alright but Lecrerc is giving it his all for this.
He's still trying to think of how to get out of the ferrari contract. Too distracted to think of anything else.
"2000-2004

2010-2013

2014-2020

The sport is broken... but it's always been broken."
Car problems does not equal driver problems. Mag is doing great with what he is driving.
Because they do that shit 4 or 5 times every race.
"To be fair, that's because Mercedes do it pretty much every race. They have a long history of it."
Almost as shit as your comment.
If you want embarrassing look no farther than your flare
Hes not entitled to the line with someone ahead of him.....
Tbh I wouldn't be mad if there was no pen. He stuck to the racing line
Same as Verstappen for for hitting Kimi in Japan. Did you ask for a drive through minimum for Verstappen?
It was a dirty move and Lewis should have known better
[deleted]
"well, He would have podium'd, probably not won."
That move wasn’t a move. Albon is mental. Glad he retired.
"Bruh no need to be so harsh, I don't think that he acted correctly, but he's still a pretty nice guy."
"No, a B-25.  Don't know what the Austrian connection would be."
It was awesome whatever it was
I root for F1 TV to work
Verstappen or Bottas

He's P5

3 place Penalty for not slowing under yellows
Might be unpopular but exciting race with a Mercedes win.
An exciting race. I’ve missed the adrenaline of watching a race with a lot of plot twist
If a different team wins then it won’t be a boring race.
Glad to be back my dude!

"Sports surge.

"No, it's just convenient to make up some of the races that were cancelled. They'll be racing twice at Silverstone and possibly another track later in the year."
In a Williams? Harsh odds.
LANDO PEREZ SAINZ
Not slowing for yellows
Not slowing down for yellow flag in qualifying
3 place grid penalty for not slowing down under yellow flags during Q3 yesterday
I think it'll be max. don't have faith bottas will be able to hold him up.
This is it
The guys who made it to Q3 have to use the same tires as Q2.
hands take longer to warm up which is crucial for a start of the race
You have to race on the tires you qualified in
Because you have to start with whatever tires you set your times with in Q2.
Heavy car plus Hards tires will cause them to fall back the pack most likely then having to overtake later on is  harder than having to defend position on hard later on when the car is lighter like you mentioned
Tires*
"Just google F1 stream, I don't know whether we can post links here."
Go to sportsurge
Tracing Point copying Ferrari engine strategy from last year too? Lol
taking care of tyres maybe
everybody else pacing so they dont burn up their softs.
Honda powaaaaa.
He is already losing time to Verstappen.
Probably doesn't want to push too much on those soft tires.
thats the kerb or when they slow for a corner
I believe one

Your web browser is working?
"No, I have F1TV, so I get no streaming at all and therefore no problems"
"Really? I think the Ferrari engine sounds awful. Not sure if it's a mic or engine issue, but I can't stand to listen to it."
Part of me wants them to all start exploding towards the end of the race (safely). Think of the drama.
Loooool
Seeing it out of the mercs to
Slower than renault damn
Anti stall system freaked out
Sportsurge.net
[best list of them](https://sportsurge.net/#/streamlist/1144)
I paid for a year so I don't have to get sky. If this is how it's going to be for the next year I'll just stick to replays
Could you try dming me? I’m trying to send it to you but I can’t
Done
"Wdc, not only win"
Yeah pretty much
He cant change the setting because it goes in anti-stall
"It's called bumpstarting.

If the car is in forward motion and you drop it into gear you can trick the engine into turning over.

I didnt know it was possible in an F1 car though."
They may add more races.
There can and Probably will be Races added
"Theirs gonna be more announced soon. Possibly Imola, Mugello, Portemo, Bahrain(x2) Abu Dhabi and possibly Texas and Canada."
I think the first 8 have been locked in
"apparently RB told him to change some setting, anti-stall kicked in, GG"
Engine kept going into Anti-Stall.
Not sure but looks like electrical system failure.
Engine issue
"mode change, anti stall for everything,"
Engine got stuck in a spec and kept going into anti stall.
What were they saying?
Why’s that?
Hopefully from the sport?
Yes.
seems a gearbox problem
probably the control unit failed
Basically everything. Had to bump start it on the second straight after it stalled.
Based on how that car failed it might not be on Honda. Looked like a hydraulic/electronic issue
"But Albon did not get all the upgrades Max got, right? Lets hope Albon can finish the race!"
One or the other. No chance both.
I think they are more obvious due to no crowds
Trash
\#notlast
“Hey!” - flies everywhere
Tbf classic Renault is williams and red bull winning championships
"Didn't they have one the most reliable engines last year?

Or is that completely my memory failing me"
"No, just keep ESPN. F1 TV is notorious for fucking up"
Same broadcast. ESPN is showing the Sky feed which is what is on the English language F1 TV broadcast.
No difference. The only thing you’re going to get from having F1 TV that you won’t get on ESPN is lve timing data and onboard cameras. Only reason I bought itis because I’m cutting the chord next month when I move so won’t have access to ESPN. Still watching on ESPN right now.
I haven’t be able get f1tv to work at all today
Probably to go to the end after the pitstop.
Theres 5 dry tires. Pirelli or the fia pick 3 for each race and then they call those the soft medium and hard. Regularly theyre numbered c1 through c5. I think these are the c2 c3 and c4 for this week.
F-zero next year theyll have the hovery part.
It’s not unusual to.
Experience helps.
Stroll is my guess
Yeah
Why wouldn't they?
A bunch of fucking VANKERS!!!!
They could but the car would be deemed illegal
Won't help when last year's car is illegally because of the engine.
3.8 now
100%
It's still very nice but imo it peaked in '17 with the bubbles
How is he still at Haas makes no sense lmao
Totally not cool. Expected a few points today.
Wdym? I never understand pit strategy cuz I’m new to this :(
They forget that they're already a pitstop behind...
No
"Yeah, same problem for me."
"Yeah, they seem to have a backup stream."
Ferrari strategist: “allow us introduce ourselves”
"Whoops spoke too early, thanks safety car"
He’s a pay driver.
Spun
Hard.
Fastest lap
"It's purple, so it's the marker that shows which driver currently holds the fastest lap of the race"
"fastest lap, awards 1 extra point at the end if he finishes in the top 10"
[deleted]
He currently holds the fastest lap
He has the fastest lap at the moment
holder of the current fastest lap
Fastest lap
Fastest lap
Fastest lap holder
fast lap
The purple? It means he currently holds the fastest laps. Whoever has the fastest lap at the end of the race earns extra points
Fastest lap
Fastest lap
Reliability never effects the mercs so dont get your Hope's up
Lol
If he can have a brake failure there so could someone else...
Two secs Ted
A car right in the firing line? Absolutely SC.
And pictures are 10 seconds behind tv :/
"Definitely, he was much faster than Bottas before sc."
"3, tops"
I give it 1 lap
Was he complaining that he wanted to be on a different compound? I couldn't really hear it over the commentary.
"It's quite fitting, really."
I’d rather have a red flag and a race restart
Yea cars are falling apart on this track for whatever reason
9th.
Fighting Sainz/Vettel for 6th before he dropped like a stone
Behind Sainz in 8th
On the track.
F
Grazie Ragazzi?
i guess the problem is between the steering wheel and the seat
How do you manage to  spin Seb’s clear mistake as a Charles mistake?
He had to pit late in the safety car so ended up at the back.
Yea wtf is with that. Also radios are terrible.
plenty of laps so yes
Probably not. Ocon alone would be tough to get past.
I think he's pretty safe
Track limit warning
Warning him that he'll get a penalty if he continues to exceed track limits
"It's a warning. If you keep doing whatever it is you are doing wrong, you will be given a black flag."
He loves an understeering car.
"and on the mediums, and on the softs"
they are not battling.
"I don't think so, Grosjean and Vettel spun. Raikonnen pitted before the SC."
"I believe so, everyone should be on the hard tyres rn"
"Chassis default, whatever that means"
Every lap he’s been on camera.
Seems inevitable
Wanna bet itll be bottas?
Ferrari was doint bad things to last year engine. In oenance they have engines from a 2015 kubota tractor.
Racing Point is good
Because the mediums will probably drop of towards the end of the race
"Nah they are free to race, they have genuine concerns about the car because the curbs are so rough here."
"I'm no expert, but those sensors let the pit wall keep an eye on everything on the car; if those are damaged or stop working, they may miss something important or damaging, which is an especially big problem when parts are limited because of the pandemic."
"If telemetry can send any data back to the pits the team doesn't know how to manage the car sans condition information. Could be dangerous.

There might be more tho I'm no expert"
Apparently the gearbox may go haywire
It depends on what the sensor is measuring. Usually “sensor issue” is synonymous to “we see strange values in our data”. Later it becomes clear if the issue is a faulty sensor or really something is wrong.
Shutdown engines or gearboxes or put them into “limp” modes.
Not enough to overturn a 25pt gap
NOoOoOoO!!!
Span out trying to overtake perez a while back
Anyone who’s paid attention
Yesterday on the pink Mercedes. Not a big one though
Mercs have been told to back off
the pink one
Your list is missing F1tv
I'm starting to think even Verstappen couldn't match their sheer pace.
"If anyone could make a wacky strategy like that work, Checo can"
His damage is that he drives for Ferrari. That's enough damage to get you stuck behind anyone.
it can when it retires apperantly
You jinxed him
"Yep, but rain is forecasted. Hopefully"
"Yes, Austria and Silverstone will have back to back weekends."
At this point Ferrari are top 3 again
They were one of the most reliable cars last year
Few of those laps are behind a safety car.
Albon pitted. Checo didn’t.
Albon pitted during SC
With all the merc engines dying the last thing you want is having pushing with the car in max power mode xD
They're just that good
would probably lose position and wouldn't be able to push hard enough to take them back after the safety car's in
Please. I'll do anything for that to happen.
I guide others to treasures I cannot possess.....
"No, racing will be much harder on the car from here on out."
"Eh, I feel like they just put that over the radio to give the rest of the teams hopes. Mercedes are probably laughing and high giving behind the scenes."
I think Perez is spooked and will hit him
He spun
:((((((( probs
He got PIT'd by a McLaren
He spinner.  Wasn't going well though.
He spun earlier. Got hung up with Sainz. Vettel’s fault.
"Did the spin thingy, couldn't pass Russell or Kimi"
"Nope, he had a spin."
Meds
They can’t race with a fucked car against competitors on softs
Didn't get the wheel nut tight
"The tethers are in the suspension, they didn't get the wheel nut on tight."
"It’s not been this chaotic since Germany last year, and that was in the rain."
First race of the season unreliability
"They aren't always like this to be fair but glad you're getting a great first race. Tune in next weekend, we'll be back here for a second race."
The tether is attached to the hub. It only works if the wheel is attached properly to the hub.
"the tether is connected to the wheel hub in case the suspension breaks of. 
here, the the wheel was not fastened correctly, so the wheel flew off."
Ah that makes sense. Thanks all
And that there’s no fans. Could have been bad.
Probably not put on properly. For example not torqued down enough or cross threaded.
Is that supposed to happen?
Who knows which 10 tho
"Yup. Under the safety car.

So either not fitted correctly, rim failure or wheel nut falure"
"He pitted when the safety car came out a few laps ago and the right front tyre wasn’t on properly, flew off. DNF."
Mclaren didn't want to double stack.
"Renault forgot about him, I'd guess"
with the wrong wing on too.
Ummm sorry no
Albon
Lol
[deleted]
All the time have to leave a space.
Nah. not much happened. Watch the clip from the Maxit and youre good.
"My guess is because the track is so short, there's very little open track space between the cars to get people on track safely."
Take me with you
Just got overtaken as I was thinking the same.
I'd hope so
Saw that too...wtf?
Grazie ragazzi macaroni spaghetti giovinazzi trulli biaggi rossi capirossi melandri
Not just you.
He’s only way ahead because he took him out.
Do you disagree with it?
Pls no.
I would not be accepting his apology this time.
"I mean Hamilton still had the inside and had to deal with understeer. Albon had younger, grippier tires and could afford to wait a lap to get past Hamilton so it seems like a racing incident brought on by Albon’s impatience to me, but it’s more fun to hate on Mercedes."
How? He got a penalty for something that would often be considered a racing incident.
Hardly seems fair. 5 second penalty for a racing incident.
If Perez saw him that was incredibly reckless. Possible that he didn't see him though
Will be a Monaco race probably when Panis won but in the modern era I’ve never seen a race like it
No. This is exceptional and quite apt for 2020.
"He is in, 4.8 seconds."
heat + out of practice
"""He turned into me!"" - man who wasn't quite ahead diving to the inside of a tight corner"
Yep
And Albon
No you are!
"Lol I was like please, please, let him be P3 and when he came of with the fastest lap I almost cried."
Make sure they hit the minimum weight after the race
"To make sure they are on the right side of the weight limit. Shouldn't be that close, but doesn't hurt to be safe."
"Bahrain.  They own a big chunk of McLaren.

Actually they own 56%

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren_Group"
Every single one
Ferrari strategy working for once is amazing
Australia is usually boring and it is annoying getting up so early and missing quali
"Given the situation it seemed more of a “racing incident” for me.

Alex was a bit too eager there given the plentiful opportunities that would’ve followed and Lewis can’t really get out of that when he’s already on full lock."
"Yeah man. The Hamilton hate on this thread is wild. I know everyone loves Albon, but what was Hamilton supposed to do?"
Isn’t a 5 second penalty a punishment?
True
"what?
Clear cut penalty, Hamilton should know better that even if he miraculously saved that corner he would be gotten on the next one"
Helps everybody but Albon...
THIS IS A YOKE
"All but Kimi, Kyvat, Sainz,, Leclerc, Verstappen and 1 other"
"I think six drivers didn't: Kimi, Gio, Max, Lec, Kvyat and Sainz"
"All but 6, couldn’t name all of them from the broadcast but Leclerc, Verstappen, Sainz, Raikkonen and two others I couldn’t quite see."
Who cares. I honestly think the only reason to ask this question is to talk sbit about those that didn't.
">Horner and Marko in absolute shambles

Karma."
Russel?
More like Verstappen only lol
How?!
How? It was a racing incident at best. Albon was clearly ahead.
"It's not their fault for winning, it's everyone else's fault for failing."
No competent teams allowed >:(
"Did Red Bull ruin F1? Or Ferrari before then? Or Williams before then? Or Mclaren before then? They were all very dominant in their times, arguably right now the grid is the tightest it has been for many years. Rare to see more than a couple of cars lapped."
Much like Red Bull and Ferrari before them.
It would be so good without them
They’re in the same bubble
"They got a freaking podium let them hug!!!!!

WOOOOOO LANDO!"
Why wouldn't they?
Classic F1
Right?
"Ferrari, Racing Point, Renault (when Cyril is talking)"
Unlikeable in what way?
I want to like them so badly.  But they are just a dumpster fire.
[deleted]
"In terms of drivers, certainly imo. I did feel bad for the team as a whole when all the Rich Energy stuff happened though."
"Hate to admit it, but I'm not certain he would. I just want him to retire and hang out with his family 😢"
"Haha yeah, hearing the cars live but certainly can't see the action very well from up there. I do wonder if most of those people had planned to go up there already, or if they saw the people up there yesterday and were inspired to go."
F1: Best I can do is one surprise podium.
That is the absolutely dumbest take I've ever seen in all of r/formula1 history.
FUCKKKKKK
Still love to see it?
A fairly common expression
"Essentially, driver screw-up"
When you've been focusing for a long time and getting physically tired and it causes you to lose concentration for a second.
You've never heard that term before? Google it
Yeah the FIA paid Haas to spin
Can’t lap a Ferrari by a Mercedes
#Blessed
not if alex takes him at the restart! have hope
Austrian chocolate bar!
taking his spot back?
Fastest lap.
Dude what? This was prime craziness
"Albons was ahead, Hamilton should have left a car's width. Very similar to Brazil and he got a penality."
I'm a Hamilton fan and that was bullshit. I'm so tired of these drivers shoving each other off. Being on the inside doesn't magically grant you right-of-way.
FIA fanboying then
Agreed
"Dont think its an engine problem, seems more like the software shat the bed"
As usual
He does seem to capitalize on a lot of other driver’s misfortune
RP has an amazing car this season
I blame COVID
Brake issues
It's his first year in a Williams.
Yes he does. He’s just not good.
"It's early days, but he may end up  worse than Kubica."
He forgot he's not in F2 any more.
"Seriously, rookies in their first race have no excuse.... except being a rookie in their first race. There is a handful of drivers across the past 30 years that are on immediately good pace in their first race. Almost all rookies are significantly slower in the first couple race weekends, then you see performance improving significantly then smaller gains over a period of time. There is absolutely no reason Latifi should be on Russell's pace in his first race.

I don't really rate Latifi and I think Russell is maybe a really great driver. 

You can say Russell was competitive to Kubica but Kubica had been out of single seater racing for a fucking age and in a very different car and different tires. He was as much of a rookie last year as Russell."
Probably not? They use Mercedes engines.
"Well I thought that they still dont know what the exact issue was. And with the technical directive getting rid of it it would silly for them to replicate it. 

And they are on mercedes engines, not ferrari ones I thought"
at least Texas comes back occasionally tho... sad hook em' noises
"That's a sensor, it can't control the pace"
Would be better if they let him trigger the radio clips himself when done talking rather than surprising him with it mid sentence.
"Albon was much further ahead of Hamilton though, I still think albon should have waited until the straight though, I think it was his race to lose."
He was on the racing line.
7th? Ya right he's going to fly now.
"rubbish, dirty hamilton driving..fool me twice yeah"
What is?
Yikes you're reaching a bit there with that one
Bye felicia
See you next week.
Tune in to MotoGP in 2 weeks time.
3 constructors on the podium....
[deleted]
Always preaching diversity until someone’s faster then him
He doesn't care anymore. Ferrari ruined him.
How come?
"Charles Leclerc flair 

you lot are really incapable of normal thoughts lmao"
I’m sure he doesn’t know you exist
Yeah that was pretty rough. Apparently he needs to learn how to race again. It seems whenever he’s actually racing and not just out in front there are issues. 🤔
"What? That penalty was ridiculous, amateur stewards"
Because he made one mistake? Every top driver has done much worse. Charles included.
No other driver would have done that?
"Well, that doesn't mean anything now."
One could argue that it seems Hamilton thinks he can use the whole track regardless of situation
"Why?

There was yellow flags and Ham didn't slow sufficiently. That's a serious offence and comes with a punishment. 

Ignoring or ignorance of yellow flags has literally resulted in a death in very recent memory. It's no joke.

A car retiring and driving slowly off line back to the pits isn't comparable. Especially since one has a precedent of punishments and the other is accepted as part of racing."
Yup it will be the same next week.
Is it for Covid or for table splinters when he goes smash?
He likes to cosplay Dexter
"The windshield is fine, it is slightly less effective but it does the same job as the cloth masks."
I actually want the biggest shitshow to happen
Did you miss the whole engine debacle?
They forgot to remove the sandbags!
Austria tends to be pretty good. Most European tracks barring Sochi and Paul Ricard are considered good tracks. Good tracks doesn't necessarily mean good racing though.
Worst is Paul Ricard
Nope.
"We in the Red Bull mode of already blaming the engine manufactuer when we don't know what the actual problem is?

RIP Red Bull's Honda relationship if that's the case"
You forget charl I'm afraid
He woke up and remembered he is Lance Stroll
"Bad luck, car broke on him"
Just bad luck. Somewhere in the car there was an electrical issue which made the car go in anti-stall mode (probably).
"Bad luck, not enough info at this stage though."
Bad luck. Car troubles
Bad luck. Gremlins in the car
Bad luck probably
Probably bad luck. They had him change an engine setting and it seemed to trigger some kind of system problem.
Bad Luck. Something failed in the car. It happens sometimes early in the season.
"Just bad luck, Car broke"
Bad luck. Looks like all systems just died on him.
"new cars, very complex and there was a problem deep inside the engine which I guess has nothing to do with the driver."
How does next Sunday sound?
Think the FIA had something to do  with it ;)
Lost power and had to retire :(
"Anti-stall issue i believe, changed a setting and car was just trundling along and he couldn’t power the car up again"
VTEC'd too much
"Could have been electric problem, maybe not engine.. Based on it was running and they didint park it. It was on anti stall and couldnt normalize. But we will hear later..."
?? Only 3
GOAT energy
"I mean, USA bumps last year literally killed Vettels car."
Not sure the extent of your mechanical knowledge but if you’ve ever been in a car with solid engine mounts it’s eye opening the amount of vibration rubber bushings can absorb. F1 cars have no bushings anywhere they’re 100% solid. Running a high curb at 150 mph is like a jackhammer hitting the wheel.
"I want one, with the lights too"
"Yeah like three times a race, twice in qualifying. Usually 3 questions. Zac brown occasionally as well but Horner is on TV every time."
In the US but watching Sky through ESPN and no response yet
"Yeah he was on the sky feed, that's what's pushed to ESPN so America saw it too"
It’s banned for next season
Next season i believe
Next season mate legal this season
Next season
First I heard it mentioned all race
"It was the first time DAS was ever used in a race, I think we can give them a pass there."
Seb was already locking up. Seb's fault.
"Vettel was completely in the wrong. Plus it looks like he maybe realised it too late. Locking up and turning before he even had contact. 

I'm not Ferrari fan but have a huge soft spot for Vettel. Gutting seeing how poor he's been at times since the move to the reds."
That was Vettel's fault no two ways about it.
">fair

Not a word I'd use for either RP driver."
"He's saying he wants power while his engineer is saying they want to turn the engines down, so I guess it's implied that he wants to have a go."
"Sky making shit up, he just said he wanted more engine power to attack bottas fairly"
He's saying I want more engine power. So yes pretty much
They should just dub in some v8s
wym bro
Noted only
They said they were looking at it but I don't think they've said the result yet
"7.7 already, my god"
Still drunk from last night
"Well, it's 10 a.m. so I just finished my morning coffee and I'll be having a glass of water soon. Thanks for the reminder"
my own tears as i watch another mercedes 1-2
Coffee.
Let us hope at least some exciting stuff
"Ooh, I just saw a Renault for 2sec!"
[deleted]
Lewis is also smashing the kerbs
Looked like a brake failure...
The tethers run through the suspension to the wheel hub/brake assembly. They don't do anything if the wheel nut isn't tight and comes off.
You can when it's in the pitlane
Carvid
"Perez didn't pit he's entirely fucked, well for at least the first few cars after, the other cars might not be fast enough to matter."
"They just need to cover 90% of the race distance and place in they first 10 positions. Technically speaking, points can be handed even with noone finishing the race"
"A race has finished with only 8 drivers before, so I don't think there's a limit! If there's another 3 DNF's, everyone gets points."
1
He has given it back
I believe in him 💪🏼💪🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Yup. This one is 100% on Alex. VER wouldn't make this mistake.
Yeah :(
Imaging if he was the one breaking the rules...
Schumi was just as big a dickhole and people seem to love him anyway. I certainly do.
He’s a good driver.
He was ahead going into the corner then Albon got ahead. I suppose Lewis was supposed to teleport out of the way
Turn right
Mercedes hate blinds people
Not apply the throttle so early
Don't understeer. Just a suggestion
You could even argue that he saved his teammate the win by doing this move. Albon was flying
"With 15% of the votes, that was a very big spread haha"
Glad they didn't. Entirely copying another car is not how f1 teams should work.
Last year in Brazil. Sainz P3
Brazil last year
Absolutely. This is the second damn time he’s done this.
He simply cannot take losing. I really don’t want to know what’s going on in Albon’s mind. Such a great race from him
You’re kidding right? Albon was making that corner easily.
Camera have shitty audio?
">I miss how they sounded back in 2000 or so.

F2004 going through eau rouge. Just expect it to take off."
"I share your glee, maybe RB can file another complaint ....."
"First grid, now this. Quaint."
"Frequently with Renault, rarely with Honda"
"how did that happen, did albon pit again?"
Atleast this isn't the US GP
"They all wore ""End Racism"" tshirts. Don't you understand that for drivers that aren't from the US, it is weird to support an US organization?"
There are perfectly valid reasons not to kneel.
"100%, the players that stood up, weather there meant too or not stood against all races been equal. That’s pretty bad for them and F1"
"I just dont know how its any controversy to do so.  It wasnt during an anthem, and its not on US soil.  Someone explain to me why."
Max's car matters
Exactly the same as previous incidents eg Verstappen on Raikkonen in Japan
It isnt
Why?
"Why? That's absolutely gutting for Max. 

All that build up, dying to get back in the car. Finally able to race and in a good shout for a podium finish. Then that."
?????
“But he’s on the curbs!” - Hamilton
What?
Calm down
BLM
Albon didnt deserve this
Unfairness and it being legal are two different thinks
"Yeah all their speed is from DAS, that's why they didn't even use it at all in their fastest laps"
Bottas might have faith he can keep Lewis behind and save some fuel/tires in the meantime
Why karma?
Think.
Red bull uses a Mclaren engine.
2?
How?
RedBull switch to Honda last year
Red bull is Honda dude.
Rbr is honda
Red Bull use Honda m8
Who's the 2nd?
Red bull is Honda tho
Red Bull is Honda mate
No it isn’t?
"RB is Honda. Last year at Australia 2 Renault Engines failed, one on fire. But not this time."
"It better be a joke. If not, where have you been since 2018? RBR had a Honda engine for the past two years"
You dumb? Red Bull has Honda
You can't just hold your line if there is another car in the way. Especially when that other car is ahead.
Your casual ass probably started watching last year
"what? no driver will ever give a place back, that is why we have stewards and that decision is on them"
Be careful what you wish for
Seriously? You'd rather have no race than a race?
Same old boring.
I dunno man this seems like a classic to me. Lots of suspense and action the whole time.
How on earth has this been a boring race?
It's not their fault Lewis can't not be dirty to Albon for one single time despite being in a UFO.
"Wet wipe because he want to win in a race??? You ok hun, the hate is shining through"
how not????????
"As a Lewis fan, idk, Albon was ahead already."
karma for your idol
Fuck Ferrari
You really cant hate them for being good...the other teams just need to catch up
HAHAHA AS FUCKING IF.
lmao
We watching the same race?
Are you serious? Did you not see the video? What agenda are you talking about
When pirated streams are more reliable it really says how shite it is.
Hahaha! redditsilver.png
"How was it intentional? He ran his line and they clashed. He's got fault in it, but it wasn't intentional."
Wot
Of course it's never God's fault.
"On that corner, against Hamilton. Has Albon never watched an old race?"
He was ahead. No debate necessary.
But albon made the move and was ahead of Hamilton?
"Divebomb around the outside

Oxymoron"
"Lol, what?  Dive-bombing around the outside isn't a thing. By definition a dive bomber is taking the inside line."
I think it was fine. Huge gap and caught Checo napping
I don’t think so. The door was wide open
"door wide open, perez turned in come on man open your eyes"
"Questionable on Checo, yeah."
Penalize Hamilton cuz he’s the best. That’s what happens when you’re the best.
ok Karen
"I agree, also it's hard to breathe in them. They suck. Also they don't make much sense outside"
Lol calm down it wasn’t that bad.
Calm down dude
"Once alright, but doing the exact same thing to the same driver twice is just SUCH fucking bullshit, Albon really deserves better."
For?
No nerds. FIGHT MILK
How the fuck?
Hamilton was at full lock
"Why? Newer tires; he had the grip and was ahead. Sure; it’s a bit dodgy to go around the outside but it’s not like he overshot that corner at all.

Edit: spelling"
But that pass was clean and Albon had the outside line and was ahead a Hamilton didn’t give him any room.
"Even though Albon was ahead by the point of collision, I’m not sure how Lewis could’ve steered out of that one. Could see it going down to a racing incident.

Be interesting to see all the angles after the race."
Ham shouldn't have closed the door. Albon was ahead. ..but I agree with you
"Ah yes, should have predicted that a world champ would drive into him after sticking a clean move"
Botass
Ring is German for race track.
"Hockenheimring, Nurburgring... 't is a german language thing."
"What do you mean it's not a ring? It's not an oval yes, but ring is a pretty much accepted term for racetracks in german speaking countries (and also a few outside those). See Nürburgring, Hockenheimring or Lausitzring for example.

It was called A1 ring as well before Red Bull bought and renovated it."
"Circuits are often called -ring; Nürbürgring, Hungaroring, Salzburgring"
Sticky wheel on Bottas' pitstop
No
"If you’re American go for the Haas team, most American thing here."
\*Stroll
No way he was getting in the points from 17th
How more tense F1 will be after that
"I think they would have announced that by now, since they are presumably currently working on the 2022 car. No reason to waste resources on it and then leave. I wouldn’t be surprised if they do leave sometime in the 2020s tho."
Yes yes he’s in danger
sainz ? open your eyes
100% Sebs fault mate
It's a safety car not a fairness car :p
yup
"It does, but often it makes for a more exciting race."
"it does, but life is not fair."
"Yes it does, it’s just part of it though."
"Yes but safety cars are part of racing.  You have to live with it.

The virtual safety car was introduced to keep the gaps but it can't be used in all situations."
Sainz is moving to Ferrari. Ricardo is taking his spot McLaren
...does it though?
"Sainz to Ferrari
Ricciardo to McLaren"
"Sainz to ferrari
Ricciardo to mclaren
Vettel is unknown"
"Sainz to Ferrari, Ricciardo to McLaren, open seat at Renault to my knowledge, and Racing Point is rebranding to Aston Martin."
"Vettel dropped by Ferrari

Sainz going from McLaren to Ferrari

Riccardo going from Renault to McLaren

Renault space currently open."
"Sainz to Ferrari 
Ricciardo to McLaren 
  
Open seats:  
  
* Williams (?) 
* Renault (1) 
* Sauber (2) 
* Mercedes (2)"
I think it's really bad it didn't sound like bullshit.
"No, it isn't"
"How so? The tyre didn't fall off, it was the wheel rim?"
Was a good overtake piss perfomance by hamilton
You are kidding right? Look at the replay again with your eyes open next time. Hamilton pointed his car at and angle then directly after running Albon off the road he straightened it up
It isn’t
Looked like he understeered a little to me.
Full lock to the left
That's because Lando wanted to drive away with the marker
start is different
"He forced Hamilton, who was further from the grass, onto the grass?"
"No, he didn't! Infact this penalty is unfair, it should be much more, you finished race of other person"
lol??? Hes in a mclaren racing against mercedes and red bull
"He got passed by literally better cars, it is not time to talk about this smh"
"I mean it's not really worth it battling with Merc and RB, because they are faster and *will* eventually drive away anyway. He'd just be risking a crash for no reason.

I'd expect him to battle with RP or Renault much more. We'll see tho."
"Not really. Oh no, he got overtaken by the most dominant car in the history of F1. I guess he's shit."
"It wasn’t an engine issue, the computer literally though everything he pressed was anti stall"
I’m just happy that they won’t show George Lucas like 100 times during the race.
"Yea I've felt it all weekend kinda feels like testing, hopefully the race will change my view on that with lots of excitement!"
Lets focus on AlbonvNorrisvPerez
That would be a real shame
It’s not as easy a job as you think
"First race after having much less human contact than ever before, give them some slack everyone’s rusty"
"I'd give them a small pass, especially today. They're incredibly out of practice"
Hard disagree
"Help us Obi-Wan Verstappen, you’re our only hope!"
Is this some weird joke? He's outperformed Gasly by any conceivable metric.
F1 hasn’t had grid girls for a little while now
they were removed in 2018
Not there Since 2018 i think
He is doing a respectable job.
Starting to think Stroll will die of old age before this bullshit does
"I wouldn’t talk, Ferrari flair"
Why does it matter?
"Kimi, Leclerc, Kvyat (I think), Verstappen and 2-3 others"
Mance
On his right? Where he could have went ? To avoid the incident?
What space???
He literally drove into the side of him lmao
"Ikr, I like Albon more but he should've known that you shouldn't overtake there. Hamilton did nothing wrong"
This is bait
Incoming instagram rant
Hamilton's fault actually
"Yeah he shouldn't have gone on the outside, this wasn't Hamilton's fault."
"This is right, it's a racing incident.

BUT, they had to apply the penalty as Albon had track position at the time of contact, and Hamilton benefited from it."
Bull shit. Lewis drove into him. Clear fault to Lewis
You're blind
"That’s quite an unpopular opinion, what don’t you like about RBR?"
Austria has produced some decent races. Could be much worse.
For what ?
"He was being a clown, that's just facts"
TBF that incident *was* his fault and he's seemed to have a number of bone-headed incidents since basically 2014
For blaming him for his stupid move? I love vettel but that was dumb as hell
"Not really, they never really say anything that Vettel doesn‘t deserve."
 Surrounded by people who have all tested negative. Give it a rest for gods sake.
"Gonna say no, despite what everyone is saying. Unclassy, but legal... just took a wide curve, he didn't change lines

Edit : well he got penalized. We obviously didn't see all the angles"
"Verstappen, Giovinazzi, Sainz, Kvyat, Leclerc and Kimi"
"Sainz, Max, Leclerc, Kvyat Couldn’t tell the others"
"Leclerc, Kimi, Sainz, Kyvat"
I think nobody took the knee
Not even close
Lewis is going to be spicy afterwards
"Hahahahaha hahahahaha Hahahaha

Melt"
Again???? /s
Mercedes is far superior to Red Bull 2010-2013
Without looking I think in 2017 he was less than 10 points from winning?
Norris and Perez are driving away from him.
Doesn't help he's driving a shit box rn
The car Is a boat anchor.
"Just how safety cars work, nothing you can do about it."
Safety more important than racing.
"It was a ~6 second lead from what I remember, not 11. Hamilton was steadily closing in."
That's the nature of the safety car. Bunches the field back up.
they'd only keep the space under a vsc
VSC allows for that but there needs to be less exposure risk for the marshalls to allow for that. Given locations its better to have the field bunched up so there is time to safely remove car.
"~~I agree it was Albons mistake. It's a shame but shit happens.~~

Edit. Nevermind apparently I know Jack shit."
He was pretty timid first laps last season too though. Fingers crossed!
I doubt this year's Red Bull had the starting issue. There was a tech issue last year that caused the bad starts
"I feel like it's the gradient pushing oil somewhere it shouldn't be, I have nothing to back these thoughts up"
Looks like brakes
"reserved for the app, iirc"
Not with that Honda engine....
"Same, I get the beginning of the race but we’ve seen very little outside top 5 so far"
What do you mean? Didn't hear anything about him
Gotta explain to daddy
how does having less gap help bottas at all? I completely disagree.
"How, hasn’t the gap drop to Bottas dropped for Lewis? I’m kinda new to this"
"I mean, nearly 1/4 of the field is out and apart from VER, all would be midfield drivers. He should be 16th right now."
No
A more apt decision would be a 5 second time penalty.
Don't jynx it!
He has break issues.
"You didn't watch the replay did you, fuckface?"
If he had fresh softs and was where he was before spinning he'd have a shot at a podium
Can you explain the tether to me? Im not familiar with that.
"Sensor issue with it, just asking them to stay off for safety most likely just incase."
Vibrations from curbs breaking things
!punt
"Well, it’s the opposite"
"""BLACK RACIST COSTS INNOCENT MAN RACE"""
Can you believe it’s also 5 seconds just like Lewis’s penalty
So what if someone else is in the place of Lewis? Should it be more than 5? Just bcoz you don’t like Lewis(ego kekw)?
"No, why would they?"
Perez hit him
I love the chaos.
Maybe he should repaint the livery again to angry reacts only.
Rolex Rolex? Rolex Rolex Rolex! Rolex Rolex
Yep yep. haha. Enjoy the downvotes.
The kneels happened before the national anthem. Most of the drivers kneeled.
They kneeled / didn’t in a line before the anthem was played. I think that was sensible
They kneeled before the national anthem
About 2/3 of the drivers kneeled
"Half of them kneeled, including Lewis ofcourse"
You tuned in too late.  Sort by /new
No you missed it. About half did.
I’d say about half of the drivers kneeled. I think you missed it.
Several kneeled with the focus on Hamilton.
you missed it
"Many kneeled. Done well and everyone stood up for the national anthem. Sensitive issue, well treated by making a gesture and not disrespecting the anthem."
Max is on mediums.
Medium vs soft tires?
Could be worse.
soft vs mediums as well for verstappen though
Shit take
One can wish FIA hampers Mercedes.
His own aggressive driving style did him in.
He literally took Albon out of the race.
Lol what? 5 seconds is the standard penalty there
it was the exact incident as in Brazil last year! this was soft and unfair on Albon!
What would have been the reason for the safety car? No one was in the racing line or in danger of being hit off track
Fuck no dude we about to have a 10 lap mad dash to the finish
Ex-fucking-aclty
Cord cutters. Don’t have access to tv. Just internet
Yeah because racism only exists in the US.
Guess you've not been following the premier league then.
Why get so upset about it?
That's...what luck is...
Lewis Hamilton burner account confirmed
this is racing
I hope so
Is it out yet?
Fast and unreliable is better than slow and unreliable
Yeah they really struggle to win constructors titles with such shocking reliability issues.
"Kneeling as a Dutch guy for an Austian anthem against racism.
Doesn't make sense does it. Max is a good guy and ofcourse supports the anti-racism statements but this made no sense."
Lmao imagine actually thinking that Seb wan't 100% to blame there
Why would sainz have to give him any room? He came from miles away and the fact he locked up was the only reason he didn’t fly into sainz?
"Sainz had committed to the turn and seb knew it, he also locked up"
"Seb locked up, all his fault."
"He didn’t have to take the lunge but he did, Sainz had the line"
There was never a gap.
Merc team representative collecting trophy for the team.
He overtook before the SC
Sensors might indicate Albon was ahead
You must be trolling
At least hide your flair when trying to defend such a ridiculous opinion
Lol ok
100% poor driving and a penalty
"Lewis absolutely deserved it, he didn't leave room to a car in the lead"
Speeding in the pit lane? It's pretty much a slam dunk.
Racing incident
Lewis absolutely deserved that penalty
They absolutely both did. And I can't believe you're saying a guy who went too fast in the pit lane didn't deserve the penalty when it's not exactly a grey area...
Vettel is a Ferrari driver
[deleted]
What bullshit.
"He's also on harder tyres, you dingus."
Well it can't be Ferrari because they can't even get past Racing Point and McLaren right now.
Verstappen is on the medium tyre.
"Check wich tires they are using, Bottas pulled away at the start since Max had to defend hard the first corners.
If the lead stays like this Max will get p1 at the end due to better strategy."
Max is also on mediums with bottas on softs
It's not so much Red Bull as much as it's whatever sorcery Mercedes is using in their cars.
Check out sportsurge.net. Plenty of decent streams there
Where have you been lol
?
"He just did, did you not see the incident between him and lando?"
he pit and put on medium
How the fuck are you blaming that on Carlos
Not a clue how you can blame that on sainz
Literally the least satisfying result
You watched the race but I don't think you understood what you saw
What precedent do you have for that?
You're so cool
Then why do they run Indycar
Such a show of sportsmanship
What a stupid comment. Both drivers have been on the podium for other teams. You must be new here.
You gave me a goddamn heart attack
Get some new glasses mate
Album was ahead and Lewis shut the door.
Lmao that was 100% on Vettel (saying that as a huge fan of his)
That was clearly all on Vettel. Moronic dive.
untrue
You mean Hamdick can't keep his cool again.
There's about a 90% chance that you are a white Dutch troll
You make yourself ridiculous
Instagram and Twitter chat is this way --->
This is bait
Because Max is the better driver and Red Bull's best chance at wins or even a title. It's not uncommon for teams to favor their first driver this way.
Because he is their #1 driver
because he is much faster then albon
What?
Delete this comment
really thought you did something here eh
Yeah typical Mag to get brake failure.
No way he was ahead
So what?
wrong..
he was ahead; Hamilton has to give him space
"Yeah he could have dissappeared there, his fault 100%"
"I mean, I agree with the sentiment but not sure how you arrived at that here?"
Wait what 😂
Stop this shit. Racism does exist in F1 but shit like this diminishes it.
wtf? that protest was fair and square after Max did get a penalty in Mexico for doing the same...
Albon was definitely ahead of him. 100% Lewis' fault
What do you mean? This is totally on Hamilton
has become...
Whatever you're on...
This aged well
Hi there downvote Dutchies!
Why do you think it's funny? There goes our only chance for a fun race man.. now its gonna be a boring 1 2
Sad little man
???
Wut....
Dude it just began
You don't have to watch.
Watch the race and you'll understand!
"Instead of a boring 1-2 Mercedes finish, there was lots of action, a few safety cars, and Sith Lord Hamilton penalized his way off the podium."
"Crazy race, Lando's podium, Hamilton out of podium: everything we wanted."
"?

Alex is like the nicest lad. Why be glad at his loss?"
This is the worst take.
Wear a mask so we can
Yes
He's won 7
"Yes, 7"
Seven of them
6 or 7
yes
Yes. Several
Yep a handful
"Yeah, a few of them. About 5 I think."
us 2019
Yes
" new i guess,yes he has double figures I believe"
"Yes, 7 total.... 4 last year."
I think his “to whom it may concern” comment was to the author of this question
7 times
"7 Wins, multiple (45) podiums with Williams & Mercedes"
"Yes, he has 7 wins. [Here's his stats](https://www.racing-reference.info/driver/Valtteri_Bottas)"
Australia last year with like 15s on Hamilton
Why would Bottas hand him free points?
Ham should maybe not spin others. Bottas is tired of letting him go past
"i tried to create an account because the illegal streams don't work on my ps4, but the box to fill out your date of birth was broken and my name apparently doesn't ""follow the right pattern""

ended up watching the race on my stupid phone lmao, goddammit F1 fix your shit what a joke"
"I really think something could have if it hadn’t been for Lewis spinning Alex. He had the right tires to put the pressure on.  
  
He was primed to force them faster, into the curbs, and risking their gearboxes."
"Nope cause he said ""Valtteri, it's James"" first, then ""Lewis, it's James"" in the second message we heard"
"God: ""Lmao"""
well that aged like milk
Facts
Except they are not. Russel was doing pretty well considering until his DNF.
">Race ends

Me: “HELL YEAH, F1 IS BACK, BITCHES!”"
There are times when you read something and hear it inside your head in a specific voice
fooooooooooooook! I guess we won't have HAAS F1 for long :S
How do vocking brakes work?
"bruh even leclerc was shocked they finished 2nd


the car is a fucking dog lol"
"Don't think it worked for anyone, really."
Yeah. There's massive load on the system. Really hope they deal with that this week so it's a bit better next week.
So...?
Well 1 I suppose
"Oh damn, well at this pace, Latifi will surely beat that!"
Merit is a bit of a stretch considering like 4 or 5 drivers that were a head of him DNF'd at that point. It was cool to see him like two seconds out of 10th though.
"Lmao yeah, there were points where I was about to stop watching, but what a finish"
Glad I just spent $60 on a year subscription so I could not watch the beginning to the first race
Change your mind yet?
It would help not only Zak haha. Probably all other 8 teams are in
I thought that the fighting with Sainz had destroyed his Podium chance but then the Landobot kicked in.
He can’t drink
What a race though!
I’m okay with that.
Sent u a pm
To be fair that was back when Team Orders weren't allowed (IIRC). Nowadays there's nothing stopping Mercedes just telling the drivers not to race so probably no need for secret messages
Indeed it was.
It really was! I loved that. Favorite moment of the day!
F2 class of 2018 working together to put one of them on the podium 😃
"Alex: Beef is well done like steak, well done motherf**** put your rake in my plate TWICE!!!!!!

(If you know you know)"
So I’ve heard. But I’m prepared and won’t be turned away because of a bad one! Been a racing (nascar) fan for a long time I know it has its ups and downs! Glad it started out well though! Won’t be one I soon forget!
No I totally understand it. I was just commenting on it
6 time world champion yet he acts like a fucking immature child the moment another driver is faster then him
mercedes 1-2 is as normal as F1 cars going vroom vroom. Didn't need to mention that
"Haha thanks, I'm going to assume they aren't all quite like this?"
Well 2 tires did flew off.
Yes of course haha. Tongue in cheek mate.
Bloody hell the adrenaline is pumping
he sure war referring to that black car
They seem to be off the pace though. Hope they can improve quickly. It will help if Vettel can stop crashing so they can get better data.
"He won Australia last year too.

Now he's gonna win Austria first race. It's basically the exact same. Just minus a few letters."
"Poor Latifi, has hoping the only rookie to take point."
Yup
It has aged beautifully
Probably /r/motorsportsstreams
/r/motorsportsstreams
Ferrari
"If nothing else, watching that gap shrink on the last lap was some kind of excitement and worth it no matter how things went."
"What??? Perez, Albon, and lando are about to make this interesting just wait"
"Pro, he yeeted that P3 sign into next week"
say what?
Thanks
Thank you! Found something just in time for the first corner.
_*eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeEEEEE.*_
Holy shit that was close to coming true
This was worse
Norris has just displayed how not to take your rival out
Seriously. Also helps that Max and Alex both lost it
And safety car
Hell yeah! Thank you!
"Strongly worded letter to FOM incoming, haha."
Streams belong in r/motorsportsstreams
What have you done?
Are you unaware of it?
It's a reference to a story. It means having your wish technically granted but in the worst way you would never wish for
It's a bad luck charm
Spain 2016
Finally 5 laps dispose the sand bags
like an infinity stone
And Ferrari is which one exactly?
At least he's getting a nice deal from all the cars dying today
Probably more like Alonso in the 2012 Ferrari
"??? no commercials is expected? Every sport has no commercials, that's not something to praise them for."
High energy PGA highlights can't go unanalyzed.
The secret ingredient is crime.
"I know, but all the rest, safety car, Max out etc."
"They get notifications on their dash but yes, if that was yellow for even a fraction of a second he needs to hand it back."
"Lol. ITs serious tho, but not that serious, if they are all tested each day and they still have the gaps."
"I mean he was slightly faster on the faster tires, this wasn't over."
"Yeah that's true, his last year with RB the main issue was engine failures, and instead of staying with the team the year they swap suppliers he went to the team that supplied the engine that failed all the time, I don't know what else he was expecting"
It better be if he is gonna stay on mediums to the end.
"I kinda feel for Seb. It was clumsy for sure but damn, that shade..."
"I got ""I think Mercedes should make Bottas let Hamilton pass due to that penalty - oops, it's the final lap, never mind"" going on in the final corners here."
Im so happy for Lando and heartbroken for Checo
"Imagine if it had been wet lmao, Latifi just cruising to multiple points."
"I agree, no idea why they didn't pit him when Albon and pretty much everybody else pitted behind him, he wasn't going tk be able to keep them behind."
"I was getting missing frames on ESPN app, but it cleared up after 10 mins of streaming.  Replays have been horrible though."
RIP
Unless you're Ferrari? Didn't they ask Leclerc to stay behind Vettel in Australia last season.
They screwed him up. A bunch of dickheads.
Yeah no shit im watching the race on twitch smh
I saw that Ocon was within striking distance in front and from behind. Would love to see battles in general rather than the Mercs just cruising.
"To be honest I'm still fairly new to F1, I've been watching for about 3 seasons and I don't recall ever seeing an F1 race with this much chaos.

I don't want every race to turn into this but it's just so unexpected that it's fun."
"Oh I love the racing, you just never really see this much craziness in F1. I promise you'll have plenty of straight racing later in the season."
"Well, how is it untypical?"
Still not as good as Buemi in china but you can't win em all ;)
"Really?! Never heard it. 

And I’ve been watching F1 for 13 odd years although not usually Sky coverage"
"Fair enough. I was talking about the fans’ opinions though, not the FIA"
If perez hadn’t backed off it would’ve been the same situation
Probably correct
Well yeah ofc some crashes and reliability helped them but Lecrerc kept it cool and overtook Norris and Perez when it counted the most.
I think he did that already. The other day. Sliced it up good. To shreds
I like your optimism. I suppose it is too much to ask for Leclerc to follow behind him?
"No, not at all"
Where you watching the same race as the rest of us? It was pretty clear that Hamilton couldn't handle the attack of Albon and made a costly (for Albon) mistake again. Albon was way out there and Hamilton drifted right into him. The 'driver error' is thus Hamilton's not Albon.
"But a Ferrari should be able to pass a Racing Point anyway, Leclerc also can’t get past Perez"
"Second last corner vs first corner isn't a whole lot of time, with most of the field in between."
He took out over 1.1 seconds in that lap alone.
"Fastest lap, he absolutely turned up. Awesome to see"
Inside track would be perfect
"They're not a small indie company running a cupcake business, they should have that fixed"
Fucking ridiculous
"Don't think so - this was 2-3 laps ago before he caught Albon.

He's much faster with DRS - 45kph faster, as opposed to just 35kph faster."
"Fuck actually your right , that would be amazing."
"Lol, yep. Using those cool big boy tricks against midfield teams. Ferrari is a bully, they act like one to be more exact cause they can't bully noone with that car"
what
"For Formula 1.5, yes."
It's like they just put a GoPro on top and just used the sound from that.
Very tinny
I won't be around for long so don't get too attached
Yes I was thinking recent times. I'm sure there's some crazy 70s race where 30 cars or retired.
Overtaking will do
Very true
All he has to do for P2 is stay within 5 secs on Hamilton now lol
They should make the No.1 drivers wear black face masks and the No.2 drivers wear bright yellow masks.
About three quarters of the drivers by my count. The camera was zoomed out and they're all wearing masks so I couldn't tell who anyone was really.
Yeah at least he didn’t spin out Carlos
Theres 10 laps left with 1 second between the top 3 and the third place car just spun. What more do you want
"But I would really like to watch on the official page, which I paid for... really frustrating after that long period of waiting for the f1 start this year. Next year german free tv will not cast any f1 races, how should this work when f1 can‘t even start a basic stream..."
But they're going to have to change the tires and when they put new ones on they'll go faster
Yup.
"Mercedes 1-2,
Max mechanical failure 
Seb spinning
And now tyre flying loose... 

F1 is definitely back!"
But the tethers are supposed to keep the wheel connected. I remember Red Bull being penalised for that with Webber a few years ago.
[deleted]
Yea idk i wouldn't be against that but also not 100% sure it was bad enough to really warrant it
Definitely
"The new Ferrari strategy, who cares about power when you have the power to force errors"
Reall great way to start your season 🙄
It's clearly intentional and for comedic effect. LOOIS KILL ALBON AGAIN
It's taking the piss my friend.
Wasn't it either Vettel fucking up or having a good race ruined by Ferrari strategy?
Watching on my cell phone because it was the first one to start working on the three devices I was trying on.
Just what we were all waiting for /s
Well it looks like he got a chance now
lmao dude
Lol yep
Perhaps.  Good point
New Mercedes Innovation incoming
They keep changing the nameeeee
Like seriously
Can't imagine there's much difference between the two tbh
Plan B to Z
use code totallytoto for 10% off
He didnt retire
So true. Kimi is the best.
"yup, lmao"
Need some lotto numbers from them!
"For sure, think they turned the engines down so the car is capable of more. Whether they can use that power is another story. Interesting races to come."
Thank you!
Thank you!
"Totally overlooked him, ninja-edited :D"
He had the penalty though
"Well, no, because he had +5s penalty. So he would have made up the time over Lando and finished 3rd instead of 4th."
They're just slow lmao
Ferrari’s finish outside of the points on pure pace. Maranello is set on fire
[This season Ferrari doesn't need to do anything.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/233/131/e09.jpg)
"It's a very strange feeling, that's for sure.
I don't know how I should feel about the BLM movement (only because there seemed to be some confusing messages going on), but it is a very powerful picture to send to the world. And I can only hope, changes can be made, for the better of the world."
Exactly.
Well...
I really hope so. I’d like for RB to avoid power unit grid penalties if at all possible later in the season.
"Depends on the number of races that end up happening. I can’t remember the cutoffs, but there are various gates."
[I'm quietly hopeful for McLaren.](https://gph.is/1I9SGVK)
"Yep, as always"
"The point still stands though, there should not be a scenario where the availability of evidence is based on the commercial arm releasing it"
"Imagine saying this last year, I can’t believe it lol"
They're the same thing
"That's a good point, maybe its too close to the intake and its picking up all the air getting sucked in."
No losing speed in the corners if you don't have brakes
"I hear you, and agree. But George has that juicy Merc contract :)"
Duh.
"Latifi better than Russel confirmed?

/s"
Mercs
Bring back goodyear
Their mediums are fresh. This is just saving the Softs for the others
"I thought it was like “we’ve had one, yes. But what about 2nd racism?”"
Lmao that would be such an indictment. Imagine
I think so. Was well off the pace before the latest run of retirements and SC tyre change opportunity. This got far more interesting
"I just saw that, balance has been restored"
Holy fuck this is truly the dankest timeline.
True. This was just chaos today
Absolutely!
The return of the Shoey!
You know Hamilton could've easily just lifted in order to avoid the contact yes? His tradjectory on the onboard it looks like Hamilton is literally taking the corner as if Albon isn't there.
"Take more kerb? After being told many times to stay off the kerbs - including the red and white ones, due to a critical issue?"
Paraphrasing but that Alex at least has been in good company to be able to go wheel to wheel with a 6 time WDC multiple times.
Out of how many cars?
Compared to 2nd. You took someone off and they go to 12th and you finish 4th after penalty.
Definitely but he overtook Perez who has arguably a better car than him
"Yeah I guess. I was talking about what looked to be an FIA guy, dude was in a suit."
You do realize that there is a pandemic at the moment right?
No shit?  I'll have to find a recording of that.
They don't want them fighting each other
Tell me how? He was obviously ahead of HAM and had no place to go HAM squeezed him out clearly.
He wouldn't but Mercedes the team want to maximise points in the constructors championship. 1st and 3rd is worth more points than 1st and 4th.
He had soft tires and Mercedes cars had hard tires. If he passed Hamilton the race changes
But there was a safety car so your point is stupid. He clearly had pace at the end and would have been able to push for a possible victory.
Safari on MacOS
yuuup same
Now they removed the onboard cameras!
Makes sense. Good call
Yupp
I don't know why I keep doing this to myself 😭
"Despite F1 not being as big as it was during Schumi\`s prime days in Germany, Vettel is still one of the most liked and recognizeable athletes in Germany. It\`s really more about the drivers than teams for me at least. Rosberg was cool tbf"
Same. I think of you when I explode sexually
Did you finish?
Ah that explains it. Cheers.
Hahahaha quite possible.
"Literally this is what I hear
“Two seconds Ted...”
Merc team radio - “smmmffshhkkkshmmshh” 
“Ahh yes Ted it’s the gearbox issue!”"
Fresher than before then. Also they're softs
"He could have got a podium, but i guess P5 is fine"
They're not going to be that much faster though as they'll be worn.
Oh and it doesn't look like Perez is really going to hold 3rd for long anyway based on that restart
I didn’t see a close view thought the tire came off the wheel.. oops
I'd be happy with a double Merc retirement to make up for both McLarens finishing
"Yeah, his pace was amazing the whole time, he got cucked hard this race."
Oh!  Good thinking there.
"No, it was not Lewis’ fault."
"Yeah, it’s getting really weird."
Lol. Reposted the wrong link
Imo it would’ve looked like that Oliver Heldens set they have up on the F1 youtube channel. Looks nice when there’re people around but makes it seem very desolate otherwise.
I don’t see the point. They all got close to congratulate each other after getting out of the cars and went right up to the team staff to spray champagne.
He knows how to race have you ever watched him when his car isn't the fastest?
At least he has another chance next week :P
Laxative timee
*2018 flashbacks*
Exactly 😂
There was no understeer.
"Exaggeration for effect. 

Albon was far more than half a car ahead. It was his place."
"Or just drink, and no spray. Who needs it? It's always seemed super silly."
"Negative results come back all the time. Sure, it's low, but why take the risk? Is spraying champagne worth the risk of losing the sport?"
"Yeah, why wouldn't the staff be wearing gloves?"
"It's not about the drivers dying. Their staff could. We also don't want to lose the sport.

Also, there are plenty of young, healthy people, who are completely derailed by COVID. They could also have permanent health issues."
"how dense are you, everyone knows it’s not about the drivers it’s about everyone else they could infect 

where have you been for the last 5 months

that aside, plenty of data and studies now show that this can fuck up your organs for a long time even if you’re asymptomatic"
"Yeah, they don't look like they've progressed much from last season, but all things considered that's understandable. Especially for a relatively small team."
I guess I'm just but hurt about Albon again. He's obviously not a shit driver - one of the best. It was more of a tongue in cheek comment but I take your point.
I didn't know RB had a similar mechanism?
Austria is the one with the kangaroos yeah?
I saw a Vettel Spin compilation on YT a few years ago. Someone could massively update it because he's added so much more since then.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you for the explanation!
H O N E S T L Y
"Knowing the stewards, they'll penalise Alex"
"Haha I know you're absolutely right, I rate Leclerc a lot but the fact he finished 2nd is more testament to how mental that race was than how he drove today (which was still fantastic)."
"Agreed, that move was pure stupidity"
"I can understand why they don't though, since there are no fans underneath them to join in on the ceremonies. Might as well be close to your crew."
"Ah, thanks! Figured she wasn’t wrong, just wasn’t sure exactly what she said."
God Bless America...
Unbelievable.... I only woke up at 6am on my day off for this....
"If you wouldnt mind a link? Maybe in a PM idk

I used to used SportsSurge but that won’t work either"
"I’m sure they have increased traffic but wow, they had so long to prepare for it"
"I’m in the States and can’t get anything, just blank screen where it’s supposed to load the race.  Tried connecting to other European countries through VPN with no luck."
Any chance you could PM me too?
"I know he didn't fight for it, but did he slow as well?"
Still lots of time for James to give Valtteri a call :P
Fuck don’t say things like that
Its actually quite easy to overtake here
"Doesn’t matter much now, but that car is just not quick enough still."
How does the driver know its one second? Does his engineer tell him or?
"Just saw that, still unsafe release from RP i think."
didn't Magnussen have a brake failure?
Even more scary if you're just having a stroll to the shop
Well I have hope for every year you see :)
have teams been caught faking an issue on 1 car so the other car can catch up?
"Carlos panik

bottas panik"
Might be having a stroke.
"ye, that's literally his first F1 race"
I thought they were all about being inclusive!
Bit silly to be watching the Mercs avoiding kerbs on turned down engines. Oh well. If they need to defend hard after this restart they may not be in the race for long.
Yeah sure but everybody behind him did pit I guess maybe they thought others would stay out if he pits? Like he now has 3 people behind him on way fresher tires. Feel like they just blew a podium
So I just saw 9 DNFs and a Mercedes 1-2 (ignoring time penalties). Not sure what you were watching. Gearbox issues presumably comparable to Lewis' usual tire issues..
"I don't think it's about Kimi's wheel

It's about Yellows on the screen

I remember seeing yellows while Crofty was cheering and hyping it up"
Yes but between the Mercedes though.
what voodoo magic did you just cast on Kvyat?
"Ah well, it wasn't to be"
Well bottas isn't gonna give Lewis anything but the team should have swapped them for timing
"that's a good point, but Bottas wouldn't have done it. i mean from his perspective that was perfect. he wins, Lewis comes 4th. that's a good points haul AND they're here again next where Bottas is strong.

Idk Lewis had pace all weekend and damn aside from reliability his luck was all bad. but he still has pace, i hope there's enough races for him to come back"
Nicee
you watch the same thing as me?  he’s let lewis past countless times last year on team orders haha
Ok nvm
F
What? I'm talking about Verstappen
Talking more about a performance stand point chief
My wet dream
Yeah rip
"They can probably cross the finish line 1-2 with the exhaust spitting flames, smoke and hunks of metal."
Definitely but Ferrari definitely don't.
I know all the British fans will give me shit for this but I honestly think Hamilton can’t cleanly overtake without merc telling his teammate to drive slower so he can pass. That’s why no matter how many races or championships he wins he’ll never be near the level of Senna or Schumacher in my opinion.
Absolutely!
Are u watching a different race buddy?
The Ferrari sounds like it's inside of a barrel. I can tolerate that. What I can't tolerate is the nails on a blackboard-ish sound of the Renault. Weirdly enough it only happens at full throttle so it almost has to be the engine rather than a broken microphone
[deleted]
"They were showing adverts at the start time and only cut to live footage three minutes after the fact.

Didn't miss anything obviously but that's never happened before."
"True, would love to see Russell just finish ahead on someone other than his team mate due to pace and not DNFs, etc. lol. I'd take P18 😂"
Also a good one!
Lame jokes are sometimes funny because of how lame they are
As I'm typing this we're still onboard with Hamilton... Don't worry there isn't a race going on elsewhere...
Yeah you’re right
Seems like it. Does RB make their own?
The salt in the wounds
Nailed it
So you’re saying the pandemic preparation probably is causing this?
Has to be lack of experience. Like Russel is a great driver but your teammate shouldn’t be that far back.
"I'm not taking about pace, but rather Mclaren using Mercedes engines again and that they have been improving the last seasons to where they are now, the fourth best team."
"Fairly new, at least not able to watch many live races so that explains that haha"
Is there a subreddit ?
We never left
I was looking at the grid like... “well... albon seems nice...”
"ah shit yeah, not really possible to tether a wheel on during a pit stop beyond the nut"
I agree
"Yeah, let's break some Mercs!!"
Sike
True but it's Hella funny tho
JUST KIDDING HAHAHAHHAHAHAH
Totally spaced Abu Dhabi
"Can't lie, I'm extremely happy Ricciardo will be heading to a team who can give him some more reliability than Renault as well"
thank you man! my stream failed and i was not aware. I saw the contact with Lewis though. Sad race for him :(
Could he have gotten a 5 second gap in a couple of laps with a compromised car? I really doubt it
Could Ham have gotten a 5 second gap in a couple of laps with a compromised car? I really doubt it
true actually lmao
I guess. I think the biggest messes I can remember were the first few races with the hybrid power units. Those were hilarious.
Do we expect RB to hire out Latifi to pop Hamilton next race or something? Williams get some extra revenue as a hit man for hire?
and schumacher has 7. 7>6
"They appealed 102412312 times for Mercedes, hope they do that for Perez now."
"No, Albon slowed then Perez slowed, Albon reacted in time. Perez didn't"
"Newish then, lol"
If they bungle into a podium here there is no hope for the midfield. Ugh I don't want to think about it.
All part of the plan /s 🤣
Its coming.
"He had no right to the racing line and should have had the awareness to leave a car width, I agree that by the end of the corner he couldn't do anything but it shouldn't have got to that point"
Will do thanks for the suggestion
"Hamilton didn't run him wide, check the on-board. A car will naturally run wide at that corner, he had a lot of steering lock aswell."
"I meant if their engines didn’t wet the bed, but we don’t race on if buts and maybes I guess"
"Those Mercedes are just too fucking fast and consistent, something the other teams can’t seem to figure out. This new era couldn’t start any sooner"
There is no race to watch anymore anyways. The only contender for Mercedes just had to retire.
20€
Just about the reliability. Its not that serious bro. Im mad for Max too.
Its a joke man.
*Laughs in ded Honda engine*
"People bitching about people bitching about Lewis Complaining

The circle of life D:"
"On first look it looked innocent enough but yeah, replay I agree the penalty is valid"
"Not sure, it's just something the Daimler ceo said he has a plan for."
You qualify P10 and get a 3 place penalty
Oh yeah good point! Still better off having ignored it
I got you!! Just don't forget to cancel the subscription in 13 days (hopefully F1 TV has sorted their shit out by then).
"Gotcha, failed to slow down under yellow flags in quali"
There was smoke coming from his engine....
0_0
Idgaf anymore :(
They just alt+f4 it seems..
Lol
"Easily, will he, who knows. Probably. Pace on the next tire and in the final 20 laps will likely be enough."
Thanks! What are the various different engine modes for?
My optimism was based on Vet being able to hang between Stroll & Daniel. But turns out it was due to both of those having engine issues. 😐
Ferrari is back bois
Gasly's redemption.
Just a mistake I think yeah
but you can compensate with the suspension more right?
"Good point, but it’s  good enough for me."
Lol we spoke too soon. We'll see about next week tho
Thats awful luck
Seems legit.
"I thought that this track was notoriously hard on tires, and with everyone else going with hards I was not sure if it was the right call"
I can't argue that....
"Even when Stroll was losing power Vettel with DRS could only gain like a tenth or so, the car is so shit."
Cheers
No upgrade for Albon  = no ranking? Lol
Ehhhh
Fixed
Please please please!!
thanks
Thanks must have missed it.
Wtf is going on at this point
"You can see on replays the wheel is gone as well, all that was left was the hub"
COVID-19 has really fucked with these cars damn
Yup. But from the looks of it Hamilton might get in trouble.
Probably forgot that this is going to cost $$$ to repair those cars too
100% agree.
Especially if both engines went boom
He passed cleanly and was pushed of the track. Was he supposed to wait for a moment when someone else decided not to push him out?
"Oh yeah I forgot about that lol, McLaren is back in the top teams"
So how long since they got a podium without Hamilton's help? 😅
Racing Point have struggled with their engine all weekend
Guess you can't blame Renault for this one...
That has nothing to do with my comment.
VSC would have definitely given bottas a cheap stop (probably hamilton too) but kept his gap instead of having Hamilton on his gearbox.
"Lot of people were having issues streaming, just wanted to keep people informed 


Also, a lot of the American watchers missed some parts of the race cause yknow freedom stuff last night"
and it's...gone.
They obviously have huge reliability issues
"So winning the race basically needs the combination of a good car and a good driver, right ? Guess Merc is the best car now. Who is considered the best driver ?"
Sounds like Lewis is asking for it
"Id forgotten what it felt like to be 2/3rds of the way through a race, where the result is a foregone conclusion, and Croft starts doing impressions to keep excitement up....Ah the warm embrace of death, take me."
"Yeah entirely respectful, to the point where he got himself a penalty for being extremely respectful."
I already watched them
Fair enough. But +20 seconds off Russell is a a joke.
If broken sensors cause a gearbox failure then that's great for the drama
"Looking at it again, he deserves the penalty. But you just know if it was someone else, it would be called good aggressive defensive driving"
Not during the anthem. That was what a lot of people were worried about.
Not during the anthem. They knelt right before it
"Maybe watching different feeds, I didn’t see any drivers kneel!"
"I should have been clearer.

They knelt or didn't kneel _before_ the anthem - but they were all supportive of the message."
"Definitely not. Merc deserves their success - best performing car (and reliable), strategy and driver. Just wish there was more competition for podium places (but the midfield fight this year should be great!)"
Albon had track position and Hamilton I would the wheel to push him off. 100% caused the crash.
At that point you lift the throttle if turning more isn't possible
No changes? Check the throttle. That understeer was not coming out of nowhere after the car already pretty much gripped before.
That'd be a very Ocon thing to do tbh.
That's not fucking Bottas. Bottas still wins.
Why? He still wins. Gets the points advantage. And it's a stronger TEAM finish.
"I wanted to make a Hitler joke here, but it's just not mein kampf of tea."
"Mate, the whole thing is gold. My missus doesn't much care for F1 but even she loved it."
I can see why he’s complaining when he’s basically us armchair watchers with a wheel in front of him.
It was a yoke!
It's a yoke!
It's a yoke!
"Yeah it was ha, Seb trying to yeet his contract"
Thanks! That makes sense.
Galaxy brain Latifi
"Oh shit, that fucking sucks! I mean I’m not hard of hearing but reading lips is way more important to communication than I realized so I can’t even imagine your pain! Hopefully it ends sooner rather than later!"
fuck man I just want williams casually up there again :(
fucking bummer man!
"The gearbox, a very important component of the electrical system. *thinking*"
Yeah but someone will report it for personal attack or something
"He’s in the acceleration zone of a corner, he’s not backing off."
Cars are dropping like flies and things only keep going in Hamilton's favour
"Friendship ended with Bottas, now Lando is my friend"
He couldnt steer in a bit? Albon was far ahead.
I'm really proud of it lol
Yes.
"I was, it wasn't entertaining. But that period was at least a short period of time at least  

The Mercedes dominance has been going on forever"
"Thanks, bro."
"Oh okay thank you, I've never seen that in any motorsports in America. Pardon my ignorance. The tire pressures are required to be at a minimum in the motorsports here."
"I see, they don't do pace laps, so that would explain it. Pardon my ignorance, in american racing, the pace laps heat up the tires instead."
Bro <3
If it’s the brakes then I would think they are gonna burn through their tires.
"What!? How could that be possible?

(Bono, tell Lewis to go to PLAN B! PLAN B! My magic F1 god powers have been discovered.)"
"Ah ok, was worried ham had damage"
"They're somehow not last now. Ahead of a WDC! 


... Man, Kimi gotta be getting sick of being stuck in an Alfa"
"Indeed, my mistake."
This is an achievement right now.
"Yep, too bad I’m banned there"
"I mean if Bottas wants to break down and we can get a Ham - Alb - Nor podium I wouldn't mind.

Ps sorry Bottas no hate."
"> What might prove an issue is that the free practices and qualifying where you set up and the car, and more importantly get used to tyre degradation was run at much lower temperatures. At today's race the track temperature is 2.5 times (in Celsius!) what it was in the free practice, so the tyre behavior that they got used to is pretty much useless

Oh for sure, but the ""heat of Austria"" line kept getting used in reference to that string of PU problems between Verstappen and Stroll. Seemed like the implication was an overheating issue.

>This is almost never an issue apart from maybe Mexico where the track is 2+km above sea level and the air is thin.

I feel like I've seen Singapore races where, despite being at night, heat negatively impacted some teams' PUs."
That’s what I was thinking
I heard he’s been in the points for 33 straight races. It’s incredible how reliable their car has been.
Yeah you right
"well they were far off the pace in quali but are on the same pace of the RB/MCL right now, so yes

Also take in mind that it should be a very draggy car"
"Possibly be but he does have a lot of previous for not having consistent race pace. Saying that, he does tend to go well at Austria so maybe it is an issue."
"Ahh I actually thought he was starting on medium actually, hence the confusion."
"Everyone will go to the end, except Perez who will need to stop for Softs towards the end. I guess RP are gambling on high tyre deg"
"LMAO.. quite new, yeah lol"
"Ohh ok, thought Mag's car was somewhat far from the turn lol"
Literally a second up per lap so far lol that's insane !! Hope at least the Mercs have a bit of a real battle between them
The pit release
That makes more sense.
"Well normally it is, looks like at this moment its from the leader. (Lap 41)"
"> it's just it makes you faster when you get close enough

*on straights"
He almost hit Latifi
*flashbacks*
[deleted]
Ah I see thanks.
Did they change them for this year?
"He kinda did, just more long term wise. I genuinely don't know who would want him, expensive driver who makes constant costly mistakes but will also want no.1 status and cause trouble with other drivers in any top team. A small team would take him on a small ass wage as their only decent driver but I can't see him taking it."
I can't believe he's still going either. I guess he just had a nose change and came out to keep racing...
Haha I wouldn’t even be surprised at this point
Oh lord please let this be it
"ohhh, thank you for the info :)"
😂
:(
Aged badly this one :(
"He was on full lock and had been since he turned in, when he was ahead."
What a meme
I got two right :)
"If it came out and ran to the end it would have guaranteed that 5 second penalty knocked him off the podium, with it not coming out Lando and Charles had to race to keep the gap down."
The outcome
but they dont matter
Hmmm
"Ah, TIL."
"I know, don't care"
Sainz Tauri drivers Leclerc Verstappen Kvyat
"I’m fine with sharing engine, gearbox, etc info but the chassis is identical. Fuck that"
Of course. Fucking bad loser
Love it
"Last championship 8 years ago. Spend as much as Merc and Ferrari. If both suppliers are having issues it points more to the common denominator. Red bull. Like mate, time for a review."
I meant what happened to Verstappen’s car
"He was? I just saw him veering off the track, driving across the gravel and then rejoining."
Maybe they ran out of money so he’s figuring out how to use kubica’s wheel
"Only my opinion of course but yeah, i think so. With how the last years have been i think he doesnt have it in him anymore, especially since there is no drives to challenge for WDC anymore. I mean he has won his, and one with Ferrari would have been the fairytale ending imo. I hope not, i like him but i cant see him continuing."
"Just typical Sky shit, really. Trying to explain how Lewis couldn't help it, or that ""Lewis was ahead at the beginning of the corner."" It's just very transparent bias."
[deleted]
"Aah thanks!

I thought I misheard it which is why I asked"
F1 fans who are members of the LGBTQ+ community lmao what else
"F1 fans who are LGBTQ, not members of an LGBTQ fan club."
"He had a dominating car and a mediocre teammate. Alonso outdrove him by miles. Seb has been beaten by the only good teammates he had, Ric and Lec. 

Sure he has 4x WDC but he will always be miles behind the GOATs of the sport"
How does it really change anything? An actual racist isn’t going to change their opinion because of some gestures.
Maybe they shouldn’t interview a 22 year old pasty Dutchman on the matter like he’s going to have any perspective.
"Considering the cars have a specific rack setup for Monaco and they just about hit 180 degrees, I’m gonna go out on a limb and say the setup for a track like Austria doesn’t have anywhere near the amount of rotation that a Monaco setup does.

Admittedly I can’t 100% prove this, but I think it’s crazy to insinuate that Lewis would rather write off an entire race than lose a position.

I know that’s not exactly what you said, but saying he could’ve avoided it but chose not to doesn’t really suggest anything else."
I've done it already.
Unless one driver is predominantly at fault I don't think a punishment is deserved. It was a daring move on the outside but Hamilton was still alongside him.
"Nah, I mean, engines can be smoking for a variety of reasons, just saying that fans are dumb sometimes with what ""proves"" what"
It was only a rumour I'd heard but from their poorly worded announcement about him leaving - they could be spiteful.
Different circumstances due to traffic though. Plus it’s 7 seconds because I didn’t notice it was interval not to leader.
Yeah I had missed that's what everyone has decided to do
"He was actually struggling to get on Norris, he was faster in the beginning, but Norris managed to keep him at bay before the SC and tyres change."
The safety car tho
"Yeah that became clear from the videos afterwards, wasn't immediately clear though - looked like something broke and the wheel popped off because of it"
"Yeah that's a poor excuse. Vettel saw them fighting, he knew they could be slower than usual. Poor judgement from him."
*siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick*
"Just deepened it, hate that selfish prick."
Oh so .0010 of a lead you should just let off the throttle? Nah
:)
"Even higher.  Sainz is 100/1 too, have three small bets intended for cashout placed right before the Ham penalty."
I sadly do. Hope to be wrong ofc and they have a dope fight but meh.
Not to mention possible balance change
Not quite 15 seconds? Would be under half that
"But like, Lance is really from my hometown. Youre right, guess ill cheer for Nich"
"ah gotcha, thanks.

Do they not have to let all drivers unlap themselves if some of them are allowed?"
Oh wow. Why are they sponsoring the halo graphics?
SC 😛
"Holy shit hahaha. So no, not close. Thanks!"
BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD
"I didnt realise Mclaren, Ferarri, Renault and Red Bull had poor owners"
"yeah, Ferarri have put every effort in this season to lose that second of pace from last year"
"Still, the Ire should be aimed at the other teams that are wasting their money and bright minds like at Ferarri"
"or spend the money better, get rid of toxic internal politics that lead to wasted time, money and talent"
Oh I know. It was worth it and the right decision. But all that appealing just to see their number one driver go out from a guaranteed podium is heart breaking
"He was behind through most of the corner, obviously so and Hamilton was on full lock having gone into the corner first and been ahead at the apex also. Albon had a better line for the exit and far better traction but your corner exit is set by the middle of the corner. He was full lock and couldn't turn further, but this was known midway through the corner, so that was an always closing gap that Hamilton couldn't not close by that point and then Albon drove into that non existing gap. 

if he was level or ahead on corner entry Hamilton would have to take a slower corner and worse exit so he could get tighter and leave space but Albon wasn't ahead at that point. 

If Hamilton jams on the brakes at that point he loses the back end of the car and takes out Albon anyway. There was no chance for Albon to pass, what happened was inevitable once he dived into a closing gap."
Give him 5 min
Or rather 3min....
He left a cars width space I think
It's a shame really to have Ferarri so off the pace...we need 2-3 teams though to challenge for wins beyond the damn Mercs
"Thanks, relatively it means my comment is great."
Just because he's on the racing line doesn't make him entiteld to hold it.
Well yeah fair point. But we don’t know what caused the issue. Maybe lewis hit something critical as well?
Fresh softs vs old hards? Nah man the victory was possible if not for albons engine issues
In professional racing overtaking around the outside happens. Its a risk but again: from a mulitple world champion you could expect that space will be given...
Im sure I saw a separate lightning in the formation with fighters/stunt planes
"It's part of the Flying Bulls, Red Bulls own airplane collection."
"Yeah, but P-38 is a bit special. Turbo charged just like F1 cars hehe"
"I have ESPN, I'm sorry F1 TV isnt working! I hope they get it fixed!"
Why? Does it relate to qualy yesterday?
Thank you!
"Yeah always, man just wants good races."
A race with barely any on track action would be boring regardless of the winner
Hope your day is full of corn fields brother
"thanks, that worked"
That makes sense. With the uncertainty it would make logistics substantially easier. Thanks!
"Never tell me the odds

—Williams Slogan circa 2021...probably"
Thanks a lot! What if I missed the race? Is there any website I can watch past races?
makes sense
"Yeah, but if the medium can last longer and Max is doing the pace he's doing... He'll be into the next race before the rest even pits!"
Gracias
Did that last year... never again!
Just heard it right now and it does sound like the engine is struggling a bit
[deleted]
"I don't know about the upgrade packages. I am sure that he can finish, but I am thinking he might not be able to push to try and challenge the Mercs or any other car that gets in front of him."
"It could be that I guess.

Although the camera angles I am noticing this on are the zoomed-in ones from the front. Crowds are usually not visible in those."
Renault was the opposite of reliable
"I thought it was only off throttle it harvested, fair enough. I thought that's what the sensor issue might have been doing."
Someone get this guy a beer
Embarrassing
He clearly loves a challenge
Assumed so. Thank you
"Ahh ok, thank you!"
Thanks!
I wasnt gonna say the color cause I'm colorblind and I couldn't tell what color it was. My guess was purple lol. But yeah that one thanks!
VSC...
I think so? I dont even remeber anymore its pretty early where I live.
"Box box, telemetry indicates the gear box has covid"
"I don‘t think the problem here is a lack of time, rather a lack of pace"
"Thought so, cheers"
would that actually cause the car to retire or would it just mean you’re going into the unknown?
dangerous enough to retire the cars?
a faulty sensor could actually do that?? they should put a faulty sensor in one of the 20 every race and have a russian roulette sort of thing lmaoo
Only with a DNF for both mercs
"I know, but wasn't he directly behind Kimi? Or was Russel in front of Kimi before?

And it was Sainz, actually :P"
I WAS HAPPY FOR HIM WHAT DID I DO NOOOO
"Google has informed me of what's going on, wicked!  RAIN RAIN RAIN!"
"Austria, cool.  Silverstone, wicked."
LOL Cheers
"Mercedes : We have gear box issues

Also Mercedes : Puts in another fastest lap."
Normality has returned
"It was going so fast, it seems there was a fence there, so hopefully no track Marshalls where it the way"
Thanks! Don't have a lot of knowledge on the technical side.
Definitely. It's all right turns until the third sector so that explains why it didn't come off earlier
Repeat of brazil and the stewarts agreed.
"I haven't seen it, I was just watching on the F1 app. But it got the most interesting first race in recent times so"
His last lap was phenomenal
cheers
Thank you. A bit sad actually
Exactly
He *should not* have gotten that punishment
"He was already fully committed to the corner, even if he braked more he'd gone into Albon. What should he have done?"
Giovinazzi I think?
Non racist people do
Sorry...took a nap after the finish. Saw the overhead. 100% Hamilton's fault. In real speed I thought maybe a racing incident.
Tell me about it. It’s actually quite a good race so far
I don’t know. I think the drivers are not that likeable and Steiner is bit of a weirdo we saw in Drive to Survive. Jokes in spite of your drivers is not really a good thing
But Ricciardo is very likeable so that cancels out Magnussen/Grosjean haha
Yeah same
Ohhh gotcha
Not anymore.
Whose software?
"Well that's why I said ""so far"". He's 13 seconds behind the next driver and continues to fall. Obviously the car doesn't help, but still not looking good for Latifi"
5 sec penalty given to Hamilton
The Lewis Penalty as I see Lewis and Mercedes protesting his penalty
Twice crashed the guy out to keep him from getting his forst podium.
Kinda ruined himself.
it's a reference weirdo
Albon was in front on a sensational move and he took him out
To be fair it was 2 mistakes... to the same guy..... within 3 races
Great race however.
Someone made a good point earlier. Lewis is so used to not being passed that whenever he comes under fire he chokes alot.
Calm down bro. It was a joke.
Maybe they'll even play they Styrian hymn given that it'll be called Styrian GP?
ahaha yes!
I missed quali yesterday.
What tracks have the best racing?
😂 Renault being Renault
I don’t think Ferrari has the pace unfortunately
No tomorrow and sunday
"Listen, it’s been so long, let me have this one"
"Yeah I mean I get something like the suspension failing upon contact, I'd guess vibrations propagate through the whole chassis so they could impact the engine as well but I was just wondering if it makes sense to point directly to kerbs when seeing failures like VER, RIC and STR had"
Thank you for the answer!
That's different than asking for Bot to let him by which was what was implied
"What’s the difference between, a Joke and 2 Dicks? GabiCristians mom can’t take a joke."
I thought it has to be completely in the pits. I remember something like that in Baku 17
"He had so much time, once Lewis took the inside to T4 just wait until the next lap"
Watch his steering angle on the replay
[deleted]
"For the exact same reason..

Hamilton torpedo on Albon."
The fact it's 2 engine suppliers. Makes me think it's a redbull issue. McLaren aren't having issues with Renault like redbull
Like what?
"Honestly, I just don’t really like max. He is my pantomime villain."
"Yea.

We don’t do that here."
"It's hysterical!!! I'm getting a lot of comedic value out of the race, not to mention it's a race!! The cars are racing, which is just great by itself!"
"But he's doing it much more than me, Wah Wah! 🤣🤣"
Of course he didn't
"Missa thinks we need a regulatory body who makes unfair things illegal.

Not to mention the fact the rules actually do say you cant have any adjustments to the suspension.  The Derps at FIA just think it's part of the steering system because you pull out the steering wheel to engage it... What a joke."

It’s a yoke
How has it been exciting? No overtakes. Clear Merc 1-2 by over 10 seconds. Only engine failures. How is that exciting? This is a racing sport? Where is the racing
"oh I can hate them, it’s unreasonable, but I can hate them."
"Maybe not intentional, but I do get the feeling Hamilton should've known better there. Anyways, at least he got the penalty. I just feel so bad for Albon."
"The rule is you get space if you're ahead at the apex, he wasn't. Hamilton was full lock, he was into the corner first at a given speed. SPeed and angle of entry dictate exit line. He was again full lock, he couldn't turn further and AFTER this decision was made when he was ahead Albon put himself in a gap that at that point you already know would close. He drove into a closing gap that had no alternative but to close when he could have stayed behind instead. That contact was on Albon."
"Lando wasn't even on the track at the apex, he went straight and punted Perez"
"Twice to the same driver, same consequence, while albon gets fucked twice"
"Ah okay thank you, I did not know that, that makes a lot more sense."
I was not aware that ring meant racetrack. That was my ignorance in play. That was lost in translation for me. Totally on me.
"I’ve heard their pretty bad, how bad are they?"
I thought he was funny and I liked his jokes and he's rather handsome
"Pretty sure the tire comes off the rim? I'll need to see a GIF to be sure. It looked like the tire-less rim was dragging on the ground, not the brake"
"He's on hard tyres with less grip. Albon could've easily waited a little, he had way more grip to make a conventional overtake."
"Ah, missed that."
Not just now..last season he was being overtaken by Renault and racing point a lot..even the alfa a few times.
Spoke too soon.
I appreciate your compassion - I disagree tho. These guys have been at it for decades. The pit lane channel does better than this and other series with many more cars are doing better as well
Why doesn't it?
"It just looks kinda silly that only 5 drivers chose not to kneel, with even the mechanics kneeling. Unity would’ve been a better photo.

That being said, everyone has the right to express themselves the way they chose to."
Cause I want to know...
Carlos
"Yes, clearly Hamilton should've headed back to his garage to build a car with more grip so he could've tightened his corner exit line."
"I agree completely, the penalty is warranted. It’s a shame but you can’t be mad at Albon and you shouldn’t be mad at Lewis in my opinion"
[deleted]
"Then dont wear masks at all then, if all of them tested negative.- The point is that its for precaution, doesn't matter that all of them tested negative, This shit can blow up quick if people half-ass something as simple as wearing a mask.,"
"A lot did, it was about 70/30 kneeling/not kneeling"
"It was pre the anthem. Think I saw 5 drivers, both Ferrari, Carlos, and maybe both Toro Rosso? 

I wonder if it’s an Italian thing with the two Italian teams

Could have got the drivers wrong tho, was hard to tell for me

Edit: typo and also want to add I respect that the drivers have chosen to show solidarity in their own way and weren’t doing so by kneeling when they didn’t want to."
"I looked it up.

He lost by almost 50 points in 2017."
Vettel just behind on mediums
Fair. But the softs should have the mediums beat for the first couple laps
The Honda engine that had nothing to do with the stoppage eh?
"Still counts, still a good drive."
Fucking hell not again
Unbelievable! Lewis just ensure Bottas the win!
"what irks me is that FIA just pulls out the penalties whenever they seem fit, why not penalize him when that happened, no they had to do it 10 laps later."
"Who cares lmao


Try to stir shit eat shit"
"Ah ok, thank you. Yea I only saw like the last 15 seconds of the national anthem"
In the garage. Classic redbull race
What's albons excuse?
I don't think so now lmao
Doesn't explain Albon
Shit team mate. Look at Max now
Albon's shite engine took him out of the race
[deleted]
"NowTv? Can watch Skysports with the internet, its what I use."
Imagine being toxic enough to literally blame Seb for everything and get away with it
"Three tenths back. ""Miles away"". Sure."
He locked up because he had to slow  more for Sainz/Leclerc in the apex
Because he had to brake more in the apex for Leclerc and Sainz? Lmfao
So just let them fight and never try to pass? Hilarious.
Cheers.. haven’t watched F1 since i was a kid so i forgot a lot of it
"No, the SC was out when Albon finished the move."
"I could careless about a flair. If Lewis was in the wrong I’d admit it. He deserved to be penalized after qualifying, but that was purely a racing incident."
Hope you guys find more speed!
Risky move by Albon
"Didnt affect the race at all, by 1kmh speeding"
Didnt affect track position
i guess i've got the wrong ferrari driver who was out of the race. earlier that sebastian vettal is still on the race.  max verstappen is offically out of the race.
sorry about that. it was a bad mistake for that i was thinking about the wrong ferrari driver.
Casual racism
Max will be P1 in the garage maybe
What the fuck is Albons excuse then
Why did Albon get blown away?
No pretty sure its Redbull
Eh?
Aye you are right. Commented without seeing the whole thing. Silly from me.
not now
"Yeah but his rear wasn’t and he turned in to sharply. Where as Ham kept his line. 

But that’s life! I’m super happy for Norris."
"give him some fucking space or end up in the gravel. Hamilton is more careful when racing Verstappen for example, in his own words. Just basic common sense."
It seemed the steering wheel was unshallowed tbh
Or be a bit more patient
Karma baby! :)
He was not 100% ahead. Racing incident at best
"Implying present tense, the same as is."
Should have known tbh
I have never liked Verstappen.
"Oh man, you really got me that one."
Mercedes apparently was given back their 3rd place after they contested. At least that’s what I just saw as a news flash
why do people not like Hamilton?
I know he’s a nice lad. And that makes it even sweeter for me to see him knocked out of the podium
Meh. I’m very happy with how the race turned out with Merc on the top. Can’t wait for the next race already
Thanks!
[deleted]
I'm a Hamilton fan. I was thinking from a team orders perspective. Mercedes will benefit from it in the constructors championship; a 1-3.
Probably not :/
"> the car is a fucking dog lol

Sure but a result is still a result. Things change quickly, you shouldn't write them off just yet, is all I'll I'm saying."
"I managed to get ir working halfway through the race... meanwhile I was watching an illegal stream. 

Fucking useless F1TV. At least the second half was extremely entertaining, no thanks to F1TV."
It's almost like the exact same thing happened last year. Does Ferrari run the fucking live stream too?
He was not at the back of the grid and had like 3 or 4 drivers between himself and his teammate. Looked like merit to me.
"Oh ok. Thanks!

But he did drink that champagne today."
"Yes he can. And he did. The drinking age in Austria is 16 for beer and wine. Even in the UK it’s 18. The milk thing comes from the fact Lando  likes milk and showed his fridge full of it, and it became a meme."
[deleted]
"I know, don't worry. I really feel for the guy. He deserves his chance to shine."
Can’t understand why people would ever think Lewis is a prick /s
Nah but they're all exciting in their own ways.
This.
"100%. What a final 10 laps. I was standing, sitting, yelling, cheering. Great race to start this wacky year."
It might still turn into a great race but for now it has been quite dull.
I spoke too soon :/
"How? In Brazil Lewis tried to overtake and missed is breaking point, causing contact. This time Lewis held the racing line coming out of a corner. One is causing an avoidable accident, one is a racing incident."
LOL!!!
"What is it? I know of the monkey seat, but not the monkey paw"
Oh ok ✌🏼
"not familiar with American sports eh?

the commercials are the main attraction"
"American sports have commercials aside from soccer. Even our racing series, Nascar and Indy, have commercials mid race."
I think there is in the US with stuff like American Football
Not in America lmao.
"Not in America, they all have commercials"
I don't think it's not uncommon for some broadcasters to have commercial breaks in the middle of the race.
"Ahhh yep, maybe I was too focused on the Lando gap visuals to think about the cars that were on screen."
I'll take your word for it because I can't remember tbh.
"Well, there are a lot of these cars going around the circuit all the time and very seldom does anything like this happen, I just don't want people thinking the cars aren't safe"
"Norris made some mistake I think, Leclerc pounced on that, which is important too.

RP fucked up by not bringing Perez in and getting new tires. He got overtaken by Lando, Leclerc and Sainz"
You tend to get mixed results when you leave a comment about poop so I preemptively hedged my bets just in case lol
Crazy
Fastest lap of the race in a Mclaren
Haha
Apparently not. Haha
"Totally agree. I like to watch without ads on the platform we pay for, I don't like to have to look for alternative sources, but they are giving me no other choice, still not working for me and I've been on another source watching for half hour."
"Ah, rad, cheers"
Albon ended up at the back of the pack yet Hamilton has ended up on the podium...!
mclaren potentially getting their first proper podium because of both the top running honda powered cars retiring? sounds like the best scenario
That’s great lmao might as well put him on the podium at this point.
True.
Yeah I decide to support it because I dont belive the crazy narratives about it and I know that racism is a problem in North America. Diversity in sports in important for me and I can only support F1's awakening.
Well that’s that for excitement today
I think I'm depressed now
"so from 4 complete power units, maybe we are looking at 3?"
"It's so sad being a Leclerc and Sainz fan, as he goes to ferrari next season :c"
No.
"I disagree, at the point where Hamilton realised Albon was alongside it was too late.

But I'm also not saying I would have done things the same way, I would've been more generous on the way in, but generosity doesn't breed championships."
Taking kerb to avoid contact is a no brainer. Always.
Jesus fucking christ what a tosser
"13, but still, he didn’t retire. In the end he did ofcourse."
Um yeah.. and he had those tires and track position because of that last SC. What are you arguing?
It's not stupid. He wasn't in that position because he ran some great race. That's the point. And how old are you that you need to throw insults into a light hearted discussion?
[deleted]
Yep. But 20 laps is a long time. Could be any of 5.
It would seem not
"Second time in 3 races... he might have been a bit cocky... he robbed albon, again, he should apologise"
How long ago are we talking?
Point difference would be too big sadly for the season
Exactly
I made a lengthy comment about how all haas needs this year is a car that works. Hopefully the brake issues were a problem related to the RBRing and not their car. You'd think companies like dallara and brembo would know what to do.
Inb4 Albon/Hamilton becomes F1s new Senna/Prost arc.
From Horner's comments it seemed like they did have something in the pipeline.
Justice!!!
"Might as well take a little hour long nap, my friend. Wait for the race to be over and the replay to be available."
They are asking me for a subscription now...what a joke :'(
No because that would be against the sub rules and I'd risk being banned... 👀😉
Don’t hurt me like that...
The scenes on here would be incredible. I’m secretly hoping. haha
"Not really, especially not without a car advantage."
"No it’s not, but George is a good driver"
Indicated via a dashboard light and/or someone can holler at home via the radio.
I think he tried to outbrake Ocon but failed
"Can't think of it. But it wouldnt make sense. In order to force a safetycar you'd basically have to sacrifice a car. No team is going to do that and even if they wanted, no driver would accept that."
DON'T PUT THIS ON ME the memes rule reality now
Great job for first race none the less!
"The season may only have 8 races, the difference of P2 to P4 May be what decides WCC at the end, if the reliability issues persist.

I’d shit myself laughing if BOT really refused and costs them the title. On the plus side, we’d have Russel in a Merc next year."
"No he didn't and when team orders *have* been used Bottas was effectively out of the title fight anyway 

Like I said he's had a fair chance every year."
Well shit. Thought it said vet. My bad mate
"Ah, then that must make Arsenal the Ferrari equivalent. No titles since a dominant mid 2000s, and firing the management that took them there."
Eh im not British but this is kindoff a stretch. Ive seen him perform pretty clean cutbacks and overtakes before. Its just that he qualifies so high that he doesnt have to do it a lot.
No?
"Mine is in karting, best feeling ever to watch your little ones follow your passion."
I expect to see more of these from you during this race now
"Not sure what you mean exactly by “pandemic preparation,” but did the delay of the season and 217 days off possibly hurt the teams? I can say most likely."
I doubt Ferrari would make a car as shocking as this 2 years in a row. They also have upgrades coming in Hungary and i think that will give us a much better view of where the Ferrari really is in comparison to the Mclaren.
Yeah it’s our communities largest complaint. It’s where all the overtakes happen and we just get views of the front cars going fast.
FUCK
"To be fair, it's a race that's never worth remembering"
Definitely can’t wait to see him in a car that’ll let him legitimately compete again. Just more fun when Danny Ric is in a good car
Didn't need to be 5 seconds though. A few tenths would have done it.
Lmao u think Hamilton isn’t winning this year. Cute
"They were side by side through the corner, ""racing line"" doesn't really exist at that point because they're both on it. He left space, they just collided when Albon got a better dig through the exit of the corner."
"Hamilton had lost the position. If it's between backing off and taking Albon out, you back off"
Watch Newcastle Vs West Ham then
"Ah, like Renault!"
You cursed RIC with that comment!!
"Will do, literally just saved my day mate! <3"
Thanks bud
"fuel savings, more power, overtake, or pit modes generally but all teams have different setups"
"There’s hardly any suspension in these cars, they rely on the sidewall mostly"
"Maybe, I'm not so sure Mercedes can solve their gearbox issues in just one week but we'll hope for better."
"When you're so much faster, just follow for the lap and overtake on the first or second straights. There was absolutely no rush"
You bet your ass!! Wooo!
"I somehow forgot about that, my bad
Edit: maybe they're using used 2019 Merc engines in addition to the 2019 merc chassis lmao"
They'll blame it on their helmet visor supplier so something.
ok
"I'd probably say Hamilton (incident today aside), but Verstappen and Leclerc are very, very close. George Russell is really good as well, but the Williams is an absolute dog of a car (better than last year's, though)."
Lewis Hamilton
"> So winning the race basically needs the combination of a good car and a good driver, right ? 

not quite, if you go back to 2012 Alonso nearly won the championship with a god awful Ferrari, however red bull and McLaren both suffered some reliability issue's

it more circumstantial than just that but in essence you are correct.

>Guess Merc is the best car now. 

most definitely however this could change latter with red bull's ability to develop their cars throughout the season

> Who is considered the best driver ? 

this is a little harder since you are comparing drivers across different teams that perform at differing levels, but the general consensus is Lewis, **on form** Vettel and Max, are the best drivers on the grid.

Ricciardo, Bottas, Perez, Leclerc all have the ability to join that conversation

the rest on the current grid is either developing or not quite on that standard or calibre of drivers.

 there are also a few drivers missing from the grid who are largely considered better than most on our current grid such as Alonso and Hulkenberg.

tbh most of the drivers operate within 3 tenths of a second stated by Sergio Perez so it's a guessing game"
"In terms of winningness, Hamilton. Current raw talent, Verstappen. Highest potential, three way split between Lando, Leclerc and Albon. Russell might be there as well, but until he gets out of a donkey cart with an engine, we won't know for sure.

I think Leclerc has the best overall balance of skill, maturity and mindset though."
"Hamilton, verstappen and lecrerc are considered the best drivers right now"
"Let me blow your mind here, it was an awful call by the stewards lmao"
"Not denying that, you asked what the point of him is and I answered."
"Yes true, I'm a Ham fan myself but it would be dope to see Albon, Perez, Norris on the podium"
"He doesn't open up the steering wheel, and albon had more room on the outside. He put himselft in a very difficult position."
"Yeah that’s true, which I reckon it was a misjudgment by Lewis as he tried to get on the pedal too soon, in an futile attempt to try and make up lost ground. This is why I agree it was his mistake, hence he deserved the penalty. But what I don’t see was why he’s being labelled “dirty” for doing that."
"He's fighting Hamilton for the WDC, the less points Hamilton wins the more chance Bottas has."
"Also me: watches Mercedes run away from everyone.


Mercedes will be fine."
a terrible one then
Was it an elecrical problem ? The swiss channel commentary is pretty trash. Anyway my point still stands
"""I don't wanna"" doesn't make the 8ncident not your fault BTW"
In general he isn't at all. In the slightest. Many of his peers point him out as being a very fair racer. Who do i believe? Them or you?
Who are you supporting today?
"No need to apologise. 

Enjoy the race/season :)"

go on the sub Reddit. sort my top of all time. or it's the pinned post. they've moved f1 off the Reddit onto the website
Mercedes smoking a little bit as well so maybe its the power unit? Interesting
LOL never bothered to look. I’d be banned quickly with my stance on basically everything.
"> Oh for sure, but the ""heat of Austria"" line kept getting used in reference to that string of PU problems between Verstappen and Stroll. Seemed like the implication was an overheating issue.

It's possible, the heat definitely mills the PUs down more, but it sure is rare that it acutally kills this many. Also I defaulted to tyres, since that was more logical for me, as my broadcast did not make the connection between the heat and PUs, they talk more about less experience with these new PUs, less time to get used to possible issues, etc"
Mercedes is just on another level
"They’re in the same position they where in quali and didn’t manage to do a single overtake, if we exclude car problems. I would hardly call this fine."
"If someone can go off there, someone else can follow it off.  


It's pretty much what happened to Bianchi."
I am so sad to see verstapen to go out. He was the only person who could challenge the Mercs
"Nah, nowhere near."
Easy money.
"No, but usually, the cars have run already a few races by then, so the kerbs don't hurt the gearbox that much, as it is more reliable. It seems Mercedes' gearbox was not strong enough for these kerbs. Usually, the would have found out this issue way earlier in the season, and the kerbs would not be such an issue"
For the last few years I just get the feeling he’s lost that loving feeling. He just doesn’t seem to want to be out there anymore.
"So badly, so very bad :("
You can't just claim the whole width of the corner for yourself just because you're full lock and understeering 😂
Fair enough. We ended up getting the result we needed tho.
If anything it'll be more scrappy if max stays in and the mclaren show up again.
I wonder why
"Merc and Ferrari spend around 400mil a year(excluding engines), Red Bull spend around the 300mil mark so no they don't spend the same. Ferrari is a literal car manufacturer who make their own engines and their last championship was in 2007. Red Bull spend considerably less, are not a car manufacturer, many of their failures have been down to engines which they buy not manufacturer and their last title was 2013. 

As for the last championship being 8 years ago, you should maybe do some maths, this will be the 7th season since they won a title but even if it was 8, if 8 is greater than 13 then you'd have a point, it's not so you don't."
"Yeah mechanical problems happen all the time, riccardio just lost his trans too."
That does make sense. I am not a fan of his but it would be shame.
"Thats gonna be a ""B R U H"" from me lmao"
"It was just a bit of understeer, which is bad, but not that bad. As for Charles, he gained 4 free positions from penalties and DNFs. He drove well, but people are acting like it was his beat drive ever."
"He can say ""racism is bad""  which he has. Idk how much perspective you need for that"
The steering rack doesn't change how much the actual wheel itself can turn.
"No, it's not about throttle. But you don't get to take the line if there is a car already in the space and you';re behind. He didn't leave a car's width. Albon had a wheel off the track and Hamilton still rammed him in the side."
Sainz is 150 in places
"Yeah I get you, after years of HAM domination (other than that one close year with Rosberg) it does feel like same old same old."
"Everything, new global partner (like Heineken etc). Theres some corners with Aramco adverts and such."
They get plenty of shit but realistically there is nothing we can do. Its logical for fans to hate the one team that's miles and miles ahead and never makes any mistakes. People always hate who dominates in any sport.
"I don't know which version of the replay you watched. 

If you go through it frame by frame you will see the moment they turn in they are perfectly level and at the apex albon is ahead by about a foot. It was Albons corner the whole time.

If he was at full lock like you say then he took the corner too hot and caused a collision. If he wasn't at full lock he didn't leave an adequate space and caused a collision. Either way Hamilton is at fault."
"
Albion was clearly ahead and the stewards agree."
"Your brain must be hurting now. Both drivers have been on the podium before. So just maybe it’s the car, not the drivers.

Or maybe you think Raikkonen is shit too?"
What is he going to do? Turn right harder? Have you ever driven anything ?
Why should it be given? It’s racing. If you run out of road trying to make a move stick then you’ve misjudged it and it’s your fault.
"Yeah, Red Bull protested the stewards decision to not penalize Lewis, so he got a 3 place grid penalty for not slowing for yellows."
Yep exactly!
"Hmm I’m not sure on that one. Channel 4 have highlights (with superior commentary and presenting team in my opinion). You can watch the highlights on 4OD, use a VPN if you aren’t in The UK."
"Thats assuming he could get close enough to Bottas to pass him, which he cant."
Could be just standard grosjean complaining though I guess
[deleted]
"A friend tells me that the sensors are linked to the engine, and if the sensor cuts out the engine stops automatically. So that's an issue, if it's the case."
P sure that's what happened to stroll...?
That'd remove the 25pt gap wouldn't it
"All good. And it's totally fine to ask questions, it's the only way to learn."
"Ah I thought you were saying WTF like you thought it was Albon's fault and Lewis didn't deserve the penalty. 

Yeah, it was my first ever live race! It was super exciting. 9 cars retired. Multiple safety cars. Drama will surely come out of the Hamilton penalty (even if it's just Hamilton himself whining on social media). All around super awesome and I can't wait for next Friday to start it all over again!"
You’re just proving his point. Accusing that the non-kneelers are racist because they don’t do a token gesture isn’t really helpful.
"I'm aware, and it was deserved. That doesn't mean that he wasn't on the racing line, does it?"
I'm sure they will but I dont think it will be overturned. Alex was at least the wheels ahead and it looked like Lewis opened his steering to stay on the racing line. Hard to say. Great finish either way but I am so disappointed for Alex.
"He went to Ferrari thinking he could achieve with them what Schumacher achieved, but that Ferrari is no more. Instead we have crappy cars with cheats."
"His move,was risky, Lewis had hard tires. What he could have done? Spin?"
"I dont really see how lewis made a mistake, look at the all the footage, albon pulled the exact same move on lewis in turn 1 and he backed out and didnt crash, albon didnt back out when lewis did it and he drove into him.

Doesnt change the fact lewis still makes less mistakes than any other driver, he has made like 5 mistakes in 3 or 4 years."
That was fucking wild!!!
Lol that might have been me haha
"Wasn't a good one, clearly."
I didn't know that there was one. Maybe they will 🤷‍♂️
"Bahrain, China, Spa (sometimes), Hungary (nowadays) 

there are others but these are off the top of my head"
Honestly I don’t think so. Those systems are pretty well insulated and made to resist this stuff. They are likely material failure or human error.
Racing point 2020 is a copy of Mercedes 2019 championship winning car.
So Hamilton smashing into Albon is necessary for a McLaren podium lol.
So messed up. This race was sooooo similar to Brazil
Hamilton must have money on Albon not getting a podium or something lmao
"What are you talking about!? Red bull barely had problems with Honda, mclaren had an insane amount of problems with Honda. I Understand you are new to the sport, but isn’t it more fun for you to learn about the sport rather than to play professor?"
"I respect that.
Still gotta feel bad for the guy. 

It's not like he's anywhere near as just blatantly shit in their attitude and general talent such as Maldonado or early career Perez."
"But it's a much more exciting race now! If the Mercs had just taken off and been ridiculously insane in front of everyone else, the race wouldn't have been like it is now. There wouldn't have been a race! Now we're wondering if Perez or LeClerc could possibly get past the Mercs in the last few laps!"
All good. It's hard to keep up sometimes.
Dw mate it happen to all of us
"No worries. Not really worth downvoting, don't mind them."
Oh it's ok. Thought I was gonna get wooooshed =))
"o, well you got me"
"A lot of good middle-field fights, and a shitton of safetycars"
Then you‘re gonna have a bad time this season
I really want to see Albon's on-board. I'm wondering if he thought he was clear and didn't realize he wasn't.
"He was on the inside curb lol, Perez had 75% of the track to work with and not hit Norris."
"Yeah but he isn’t intentionally targeting albon. I will agree that brazil was 100% down to poor driving from lewis. But todays incident was closer to a racing incident.

Drivers have got away with no penalty for more severe incidents."
"Yes. I’m sure as Lewis was already full lock into a corner he spotted Alex making the overtake and thought “Ah look. It’s Alex, let me fuck up my own race while ruining his again”.

Give your head a wobble mate."
"all good, always happy to help"
"They were very promising 2 seasons(?) ago but alot of driver mistakes and de-evolution of car development put them in a bad place.

And at the time of writing this MAG just overshot the corner..."
His boneheaded move today speaks for itself
"The tyre was still on the rim, I think what you saw was the hub where the wheel is mounted. But if you find a gif, do share it, maybe I'm wrong!"
"And last season he was overtaking Renauls and racing points, and even the alfa. 

It's racing. Sometimes your car and strategy is faster, and sometimes it's not. I don't know wtf you're on about. And what does this have to do with your original comment?"
Because taking a knee is not the default and certainly not only the position against racism. That's just one of many.
Because they are all against it?
Albon was ahead even in the mid corner. Rules are rules.
Maybe they were right. Vettel is a bit of a selfish prick him not getting his way and not being number 1 might be a good reason they want to get rid of him. Who knows the situation behind the scenes.
Ah I missed it!
"Ah ok. Well that is the closest he came to winning in all fairness, this Mercedes dominance is almost unprecedented. Even the early 2000 Ferrari had more competition."
"I hope he gets points. I like Williams and RUS, but having to hope 1/4 of the field to breakdown to have a chance of sneaking into the top 10 is sad."
I didn’t even realize that. It’s definitely pretty sus. But FIA hasn’t really been very stalwartly in the past.
100% worth it
Old front wing? like you could have known that?
That’s what I’m saying man!
There was never a gap?
"You do realise that a pretty fundamental part of motor racing is anticipating the actions of others? He failed to do that, had to slam on the brakes and locked up. It is not Charles or Carlos's fault and a feature of Vettel's driving that he has these mind farts"
"? Vettel tried to overtake sainz and locked up and crashed into him, he was never ahead."
He tried it and miscalculated 🤷🏽‍♂️ no investigation necessary
you picked an exciting one to come back to!
I guess race control is wrong and youre right
What a joke. Albon was clearly ahead
Hope you find more penalties!
"Lal, no. If you can't understand it you are anyways a lost cause"
"Albon had only just gotten overtaken by lewis with DRS when I wrote this. Still though, Albon was blowing Lando away too, looks like Mercedes dominance more than red bull failure"
Do you see 2 Merc drivers on that podium?
It happens. I blamed Leclerc initially for his brake failure in Monaco a couple of years back.
the real question is why didnt they give max the more reliable engine aswell :p ? its common practice in f1 to give the faster driver the most recent parts first.
"FIA disagrees, Ham has to be better than that"
Or hamilton could have let space as he is supposed to instead of causing a collision
Its not debatable that Albon was ahead of him. That is a fact
You trippin
"Think of him like the Yankees. He has lots and lots of fans, but also a shit ton of haters."
"Of course, no problem."
"And Bottas is trying to win the championship. It would be dumb to let Lewis pass and reduce his championship lead, especially when it looks like Merc, aside from their issues with Austria’s kerbs, are in a class of their own."
shit is sad man :(
"Kicked in for me just after Max dropped out. Even then though, the commentary appeared to have about a 10-second lag."
"Situation is different though. To the viewer it's the same problem. But on the backend they are most probably dealing with a massive uptick in viewers. That said, they should have seen it coming. I'm wondering if they're running into scaling issues with their service."
"His last lap was insane!

Albon got screwed over again. He clearly had the outside around Lewis and Lewis didn’t give him room. Oh well, that’s racing"
It’s annoying because I really liked Hamilton early in his career and I have no issue with his political stances but as a driver I just can’t stand his constant whingeing. It’s fair for Russell to complain in the slowest car but Hamilton always throws a shit fit if he’s any position lower then 1st. There’s competitiveness and then there’s just being a spoiled little shit and to me that’s all Hamilton is now.
Norris has just displayed how not to take your rival out
"It’s a fictional story about a monkeys paw that grants 3 wishes, however they all come with massive consequences. For example you wish for a million dollars but as opposed to just receiving it, it is instead given to you via an issuance settlement because your son died at his job.

So we wished for F1 back. But exciting drivers drop immediately."
damn
"That's unfortunate but you cant base it off the result to the other driver, he didn't really give the space but he also didn't really turn into him but that's my opinion maybe 5 is not enough but yea drive through may also be to much"
Karma lol
"By the rate the cars drop out, that's sure possible, haha"
"Definitely. I think it is late in coming, but better late than never."
"At least you’re not alone? 

Fack."
"I'd argue that giving space in order to avoid contact isn't generosity, more common sense. Of course neither of us can prove exactly when Hamilton realised Albon was along side him but I'd like to think he knew what was going to happen well before they even got to the point of contact. Albon was on new softs and was clearly much faster I'm sure Lewis was expecting it."
"Given the contact happened on the track, while there was still space to the left, Albons tyre hit the rear of Hamilton's tyre, hamilton's steering angle didn't change and he didn't go anywhere near the white line, let along the kerb on the exit, surely Albon could have taken more kerb to avoid contact?

I still see this as a racing incident, we've heard from other former drivers that there's nothing Hamilton could have done, so how is it worthy of a penalty?"
Lifting off the throttle and not forcing contact is also a no brainer for Hamilton.
So he cost him 10 positions and multiple seconds and Lewis gets a 5 second penalty to finish 4th
What insult? All I said is your point was stupid. It doesn’t matter how he was in that position it only matters that he was. Safety cars are part of racing so taking advantage of them is also part of racing. He put himself in position to take advantage of it with fresher tires.
Same lol 30km to Heppenheim
He hasn't got a chance to lost them owing to the SC. Feel really bad for him. I was rooting for him.
Oh no doubt he's in the wrong. But to say he needs to learn how to race is just ignorant.
Basically anything pre-2014 other than his first 2 years with McLaren (even in those years he showed he can race). Did you ever watch him in GP2? He was literally known as being the guy that can overtake anywhere.
"Yeah, that's true. I hope their car does actually work. I find the RBR a difficult track to gauge cars performances on. 

I also find it weird how you have top car/car parts manufacturers not producing ""the best"" stuff, but an energy drinks company has a very good car (albeit they get the engine from Honda). I don't know how it all works tbf."
I really hope the next Drive To Survive focuses on this angle.
3 drs zones back to back is the advantage
Okay okay last question. How does the lead driver know when to activate DRS? Technically theres no one in front him.
"Yeah, honestly fair play to him"
So now bottas is points ahead I hope lewis is letting him past each race 🥴😉
"Ironically, I’m an Arsenal and Ferrari fan :("
Yeah that’s fair enough I know I’m being pretty hyperbolic but I just find it so frustrating to see all the rubbish George gets for complaining about the drive of the worst car on the grid but turn a blind eye to the continuous verbal shit that spews from Hamilton’s mouth the moment he’s overtaken by another driver or the team screws up a strategy. Just once I’d like to see him drive a mid field car and he see how good of a driver he really is because I feel if he was with another other team he would have the same reputation as a Magnussen or a Pérez.
"Haha, hopefuly I can deliver"
"I guess I'm assuming the rules were similar between motorsports. For Nascar, they weren't able to be in the shops until a week or 2 before the event. At the shops and when they are at the track, they have limited crews. Is this not the case for F1? I would have assumed it was since they were travelling between countries. I might be totally off base. If I am, I apologize."
"I mean, its kinda expected to have lots of titles when you are the driver in f1 history who has driven the highest number of best cars on the grid. He has had the best car for like 9 seasons"
some one is butt hurt cause lewis didnt get a podium
He didn't leave a car's width though. If he'd been on the outside I'm sure he wouldn't have been happy to have the same thing done to him. He got the penalty and that's just racing. Just a bit upset for Albon as it was his time to shine especially as he couldn't be directly compared to Max for once
"Why does Hamilton have to back off? Hamilton had the corner on the inside on entry. By your measures, one can also say: its not Hamiltons fault albon tried to go around the outside.

I wanted albon to overtake Hamilton, but to go around the outside like that you'd have to be in front on corner entry, and he wasn't."
Bro I just jinxed Daniel nooo
I really did smh
"Understood, cheers for explaining"
exactly. with the 18 inch tires but more compliant suspension you could potentially set it up to deal with the curbs better
"No, when you're a racer you pass when you have the chance to do so.

And again, something that you can't deny: it was not his fault, he was ahead, he passed cleanly, he was pushed out by a driver that didn't concede the position was lost."
That's quite detailed. Thanks!!
Then why does everyone seem to hate Hamilton over here?
"I think it's more that people see midfield drivers back out when they're passed like that and Lewis won't.

He's a great driver but again it seems like the wrong choice when he could have continued in 3rd and taken the podium. Brazil was more of a punt but the fact that it's the and driver again hurts fans more."
Aren't you a delight
That was Horners explanation so 50/50 its bullshit. I dont think they'd have attempted changing the steering wheel if it were a mechanical issue though.
"Uh oh lol

""Gearbox issue is critical."" From Bono yikes!"
"Albon is turning in, as is Lewis. There is nothing Lewis can do, if he backs off his car is still moving left, meaning he’d still clip Albon."
He's crashed Albon out of a podium place twice now after getting passed... That says everything
The joy of starting having never watched means I can take the entire race in without bias.
"Thank you, you too!"
"Oh okay good to know, thank you for the information! 
I'm trying to just learn as I watch, I've been a nascar fan for 20+ years. I've been trying to get into other forms of racing recently. IndyCar I started this year, and this is my 1st experience with F1. I've played the PS4, game, but that's not the same lol. I know its vastly different, so I'm excited to learn! 

I'm curious to see the amount of difference from IndyCar too!"
"You wouldn’t, I was for saying f not fuck Kyle Busch"
Red bull own a 2nd team. That money spent is more then enough to compete. I don't understand your point about past championships. Redbull more recently should indicate they would be more competitive. Their fall of as been bigger. Ferrari have at least pushed Merc in season before. Red bull firmly 3rd. If you think that's good enough your bias is to great.
"Apologies for using the incorrect terminology. Can you correct me on what is actually adjusted?

My point remains though that I don’t believe that the setups for today would’ve allowed for more rotation, especially after comparing on boards of different drivers.

(And also the whole Lewis choosing to have a collision)."
"He left so much room mate, he's on the racing line, you sweep out wide on that corner"
"Damn, does that include cash-out? 

I kinda go for the sites that have a piss-poor F1 monitoring that are slower at suspending cash-outs."
Back out. If he overcommited then thats on lewis as well.
"He didnt run out of road. Hamilton didnt leave enough space. And why should space be given? Because if not, everyone defending can just push the overtaker off track endlessly. That would make for pisspoor racing.

Also, it’s in the rules. Causing a collision is illegal and the FIA has documented the rules on racing lines during overtaking. Fact is: what Lewis did was illegal and unsportsmanlike."
All he needs to do it keep following until the pit window opens.... Then he's going to haul ass.
"Oh wow, I was guessing, purple or blue, or it could have been pink lol. That's my life, purple or blue, I always have a 50% chance lol."
I was aiming for that with my comment yeah
"Haha, I meant it more like, in surprise. 

I'm still not over the fact that McLaren are now P2 in the constructors. It's insanity, this race was amazing"
"If even after all this dialogue and everything that happened this year, besides working with Lewis, not kneeling it's pretty fucked up in my opinion. Hence why it was the minority who didn't knee"
Which racing line? Mercedes told both drivers to change their racing lines if you recall. “The racing line” isn’t some concrete thing.
They’ll say that at the start of steering they are side by side and that Lewis never changes his steering angle and that it is impossible to add more steering angle without spinning
Ferrari hasn't been the best but neither has vettel. He has been making a crazy amount of mistakes on top of lacking pace.  Leclerc sitting on p2 while Seb is driving into people half way down the grid.
A risky move in a the most prestigious racing series in the world? How dare he
Hahahaha
Thanks!
That's what I thought as well! Thanks for the input
[deleted]
Hahaha cause Honda is known for its reliability in this sport. Check your history bud.
American spotted lmao
:)
:)
Thanks! :)
Sorry!
Race director hasn't shown much of any of that. Plus those fights are not even in the points. So who really cares.
"Not about Albon but Hamiltons mentality. He added the throttle after the car was gripping enough not to push Albon, who was ahead, off track."
"It has everything to do with my comment..he gets overtaken too easily and he can't hold onto a lead, he's very bad at defending his position and up until now I honestly thought that was obvious to everyone."
"The rules of physics trump everything. You commit on corner entry, there's nothing Hamilton can do if Albon decides to cut across Hamilton's tightest possible line."
It's pretty clear it's just a slow car
Leclerc took about as much kerb as Seb did in the corner. There was a gap.
"He didn't crash into Sainz, lmao. There's no damage."
absolutely! The end was insane. cant wait till next week
"Oh yeah, cause nobody has even criticised race control on here before."
That doesn’t mean it’s not a racing incident.
And more wins! ;)
"Wow blowing away a midfield Mclaren, clap, clap."
"Yup I’m fine, thems the breaks."
For anything in particular or just cause he wins a lot?
"With the 5 second penalty Hamilton still would have been classified behind Bottas.

That said he helped him along with DRS for several laps and still couldn't pull out the difference required."
"Id be interested to see the percent change year to year between 2018 to 2019, and 2019 to 2020. They are sponsored by AWS, maybe use that to host the content instead of useless graphics."
"To be fair, like half of the driver radio messages Sky plays in each race are from Hamilton, so we probably have a skewed narrative. My guess is Hamilton is probably not an outlier.

That said: he comes across like his tires are always gone by their third lap, his strategy is always fucked, and he's always lucky just to drag it across the line."
What does that even mean?
"Ok I understand perfectly now, thankyou. 🙏🏼"
"You absolutely can, every situation is unique so you need to look at the cause and effect of an incident to ascertain the correct penalty.

I've become a Clerk of the Course this year and spent several years in race control, that one was too light."
"This is so fucked for his championship chances, first race 0 points, fuck me"
"If you've ever been on a race track, either real life or digital, it **is** generosity. Common sense is to shut the door and drift wide early to block the run.

You seem to be arguing like I'm defending Hamilton. I've stated multiple times that he deserved the penalty."
"It’s really frustrating, but they *should* check penalties for similar things that happened in previous races and I’m going to have faith in humanity and say they did."
[deleted]
"Yeah, Lewis and Val are too old and too wise i reckon. Could've been close though."
"Yeah but here we are 6 years later, and it seems there’s contact whenever he’s actually racing someone. Leclerc, Albon, Albon again. That incident in Austin iirc"
Yep and the reason it has 3 is because it's a difficult track to overtake.
"It’s not available to the driver since there isn’t a gap of a driver in front of them. (Unless there is a lapped car in front of them.)

Ask why! Happy to help."
Yeah because Mercedes used team orders on Bottas in race two? You're not helping your argument with stupid comments like that 😂🤣🙃🤪
"Don’t apologize! Thank you for explaining what you meant.

I would agree that did affect teams - either not as many people allowed in the factories, social distancing rules, not as much training or testing time etc. The F1 teams do have their full crews though - all 4,032 people were strict with quarantine and tested before this weekend."
"Actually he did. Given that almost always drivers use the kerb on the outside coming out of that corner, he had track width and kerb width to use."
"He has to back off because you said contact was inevitable and Albon was waaaay infront of him by that point. I blame it on Hamilton running him out, but if you think contact is inevitable then he should have backed off."
"I'm not saying it was his fault, but he put himself in a position to ruin his own race and paid for it"
No problem
"He's a good driver, a consistent driver, in a dominant car. He has a big personality and sometimes lashes out emotionally at people and that ostracizes him a bit. He rubs people the wrong way some times. The meme of him constantly bitching about his tires, that's definitely rooted in a pattern of behaviour. His torpedo actions against Albon is another. Straight up cutting chicanes is also another."
People are just annoyed when one driver wins so much.
You're talking as if overtaking round the outside is unheard of. People don't hit people overtaking them generally
So two incidents with Albon within a career that spans 13 years makes Hamilton a dirty driver? Okay princess.
That's fair! Enjoy
"They own a second team, that changes the performance of their two cars and prevents engine failures. 

They spent more than enough to compete and won 8 more titles than Ferrari since Ferrari's last title.... I'm not arguing that Red Bull have been brilliant we're talking about why Ferrari get so much shit. They spend more and have achieved a lot less than Red Bull in recent history. If Ferrari had won from 2009-2013 and Red Bull's last championship was 2007 and they spent 33% more than Ferrari... guess who would get more shit?"
The monaco steering rack results in the front wheels turning more for the same amount of steering input on the wheel. It doesn't change how much the steering wheel itself is able to rotate.
Not if you are going to hit a car doing it.
"Dunno if it includes cash out but those are the odds, I'm guessing it will. Use oddschecker.com before placing bets"
"Yeah they can say that. Hard to say like I said, its such a complicated thing when the cars are so close in the corner like that."
"You’re leaving the build up and focusing on the end result. This is the result of years at Ferrari with Ferrari really not making a dent in Merc’s car development. Add to that Ferrari’s hilariously bad race strategy race after race. He’s had enough. Also, he didn’t reject to renew his contract with Ferrari - they never even offered him one. Surely that doesn’t help his motivation to race for a team like that in 2020. I think Vettel has been mentally done with Ferrari since the end of the 2018 season."
Risk = danger + opportunity.

Of course the mclaren Honda is the only place Honda had in F1. Stop embarrassing yourself.
"Me? Nah mate, I'm Australian."
So he accelerated out of a corner?
">there's nothing Hamilton can do 
Yes turn right a bit more"
"Well, welcome back!  Who is your money on now for next week, now we've seen the raw power/reliability issues etc?"
"A mix of reasons. Some don’t like his personality, others probably for racist reasons, and others probably because he’s the face of the winning team that has made F1 fairly boring to watch."
"Lewis would have scored more points if Bottas let him past. Bottas is in a better championship position with Lewis in fourth rather than third. 

When has a championship contender ever actively tried to help their rival score more points?"
"It means it's very possible to lose a place through that same corner and not oversteer into your rival. Either way the point is moot now, the race stewards agree he was at fault"
But Albon was already ahead halfway through the turn so there was no door to shut. If Hamilton was ahead it'd be a completely different story.
Darmstadt
And Perez too. It could've. :(
No doubt he's made mistakes but he has shown that he is arguably one of the best at battling for position when his head is in the right place.
So that's unfair isnt it? Or is it like that to promote racing?
"“Bottas this is James” followed by basically let lewis overtake or hold up cars behind.  Even the commentators expected bottas & lewis to swap at some point during the race, that’s how much of a joke it is."
"Well I realized I totally assumed F1 did the same thing as Nascar, and I know very little about F1, I'm watching my 1st race. I realized I was that guy I hate in the Nascar world who knows nothing about it but acts like he does. Like the political people trying to weigh in on the Bubba Wallace Situation. 

F1 seems like they need everyone with how much more technical these cars are. Nascar could have people work remotely. That's a lot of people. Wow. I believe you, every other country has taken this more seriously than America. That's a whole other issue."
You have given me a lot of material to look up! Thanks a lot!!
2 instances in the last few races... His recent history is certainly dirty!
"Well that's not good for you, eh?"
Yes. So how is the redbull engine still having issues? Ferrari issues in 2017 were driver related. 2018 Merc just better. But we are talking about the hybrid era. Red bull have been so poor. But people just accept them 3rf now. It's not good enough. Wtf are you talking about 8 more titles? Redbull haven't  done that mate
"If the rotation of the wheel stays the same on the car then I have to admit I’m wrong then.

Still a hard disagree on Lewis choosing not to avoid Alex. That would suggest intentionally crashing and that’s a dark, slippery road."
With it being close to call I think they might try and run saying it’s a racing incident and thus not penalty worthy
I get all that. Doesn't take away from the fact that Seb has been dropping the ball big time.
"Mate, they haven't made a good engine since the 90s just cause your boi's at Redbull are running them doesn't make them good lmao."
"Ok, so he turns right more, which he can't do - because as we've previously covered, he doesn't have time to go back to his garage and build a car with more grip - so he loses traction, oversteers and crashes into Albon. Great!"
I think albon and verstappen might get a spot on the podium.. but i think mercedes will still take it. I’ll probably be way off... you?
At that point it's still a team game and I think it's been hammered into #2 driver Bottas that he's there to help the team. His seat is still not confirmed for next year and I don't think they have the confidence in Bottas to be their only threat for the driver's championship this year.
"Contact can be a racing incident and not a punishable offence. This one could have gone either way, but saying 'look there was an overtake and they didn't crash into each other' is a real weird argument to make for one person deserving a penalty."
I don't feel like this is going anywhere. Have a good evening.
He's taken it back. Rightly so too. I don't know why he didn't wait to be told. Rookie mistake.
"I don’t think he’s shown much of that lately at all though. Ever since Mercedes dominance it seems like more and more it’s HAM involved with something and has an excuse. Anyway. I’m not really looking to argue. I know he’s a great racer, and he’s the reason I’m here in the first place. Just tired of seeing podiums be wiped away because he’s too aggressive or unaware in these types of situations."
"Now that’s up for debate haha, I would say it promotes racing and drama.

There’s also designated zones on the track DRS can be used so it can be chalked up to additional strategy."
And what race was that in? Was Bottas fighting for the championship? Like I said your argument is a joke 😂🤣🤪
And his career and thus him as a racer in general?
"Can't say I'm happy about it, but still happy that racing is back.."
"2018 the Ferrari was the better car and the issues were driver related, Vettel made more mistakes and dropped more points in 2018. Why are Redbull still having engine issues, everyone has engine issues. THey had years with Renault who had horrendous reliability, they've had better reliability but they are still Honda engines, not Red Bull and they still aren't directly responsible for those engines. 

Red bull have won 4 driver titles and 4 constructor titles. 

As for 'we are talking about they hybrid era"", no we aren't and weren't, you never stated that at any point. You're now trying to reframe it because you've been shown why Ferrari get more shit and don't like it so have decided to change your argument. You only ever said why do Ferrari get shit and Red Bull don't. Quite aside from the fact that Red Bull do get shit for fucking up repeatedly, Ferrari get more shit because they've spent more and achieved less compared to Red Bull recently."
Yeah we'll never know for sure.
"They literally just got back into F1 building an engine competitive to the top of the grid. It’s not even an argument where you are going, you are just shouting random things. Figure out what you want to say before you say something."
"I reckon Hamilton, but I’m also hopeful Alvin or Norris can get the top step."
"At this point it’s anyone’s game. Imagine Bottas letting Lewis get third and then Bottas missing the championship by that much. 

You don’t win championships by giving your rival free points. Alonso never would have done that, Rosberg never would have done that, why should Bottas?"
No he deserved his penalty for needlessly ruining Albon's race. Just to make that clear
Yeah! I'm so Happy!
I guess that's that.
Yeah thats fair enough. I was pissed off as well when he hit Albon.
"Alright I've got another question, William's uses the same engine as Merc (alongside others like RP). Theoretically they should be the same speed. How come they're so far behind?"
"I don’t know I’ve not written it down and I’m still watching the TV.. dunno why you’re the only person oblivious to it, it’s become a running joke.  You keep pretending it doesn’t happen 😂🤪🤓🤣🤓😉"
If we're talking career then he has a history of lying to stewards and officials from the start up until just yesterday... But I'm not going to argue with someone bitter enough to downvotes all on my responses.
"""Literally just got back into F1"", are you new to the sport? They have been here since 2015, you have lost the plot mate."
It's not needlessly ruining Albons race when he's trying to defend the position and they make contact. Brazil was needlessly ruining Albons race. This was a racing incident that could have gone either way. Penalty is fine but I also wouldn't have been suprised if it was a 'no further action'.
"I don't know why people are saying he is performing the same as gasly.

Oh my.

Still he's done better with less time in the car and is far more confident."
Hamilton was a bit stingy with the space considering how close they were. I dont think he was entitled to racing line. Albon was already there.
"It’s could or couldn’t not be the same exact engine - Mercedes does provide them AN engine, doesn’t mean the same engine.

Also, going back to how sensitive the cars are, each car is built differently so how the Mercedes gearbox interacts with the engine and the rest of the car is different!"
"It's a joke, not reality. Like I said Bottas has had a fair chance every year. I never said team orders don't happen (and Hamilton has had then too)  I'm saying its never cost Bottas a shot at the championship. Apparently you need to work on your reading comprehension? Or maybe you're just lying because you know I'm right? 😂🤣🤪🙃😂🤣🤪🙃"
I'm not at all bitter. Just disputing your bullshit view as Lewis as a dirty racer.
"Aah starting arguments for the sake of winning instead of maturely discussing something, I remember doing that at the age of 12. Just being here over 4 years is peanuts and the “historically unreliable” you are spewing out is just those years with mclaren.

Kid just first decide why you want to say, then talk to me because it leads nowhere."
He's a wonderful driver with a load of bad luck.
It's Brazil 2019 all over again.
"Sorry for late reply was cursing at my tv (fucking alex and lewis) 

So when Williams signs the contract with Merc arent the specs lined out? Dont they negotiate for the same engine?"
"It’s become a joke because of how much it happens, like the meme of “VALTTERI ITS JAMES”.. I’d say putting Bottas 2nd most races would compromise his chance of a championship as the way it works is that the person who finishes higher gets more points, which means they can win the championship!!  More points = better!!! 🥴 thought I’d explain for you! 😉🤪🤣🥴"
"Ok I'll change the phrasing for you. Hamilton as of late has been a very dirty racer, he also has a history through his entire career of using dirty tactics such as lying to stewards. Happy?"
"> Kid just first decide why you want to say, then talk to me because it leads nowhere.

Are you having a stroke? Honda is the largest engine manufacturers in the world with one of the biggest R&D budgets in the sport, and they are still barely competitive with the aero on the Redbull (with a budget just as large) dragging them into the top 3. Admit it Honda is garbage."
A 5 second penalty is laughable. And I've supported Hamilton since he first came in
"Haha well if you're gonna keep lying I'll leave you to it 🤪🤣😂🙃🤪

Have fun mate 🤣😂🙃🤪🤣😂🙃🤪🤣😂"
Whatever helps you sleep at night. You're wrong and the stats back it up.
"Wow largest engine manufacturer? And that was just exclusively Formula1 engines over the last decades? Oooh no not.

This is exactly what I mean, you use an argument, it doesn’t support your statement, you still spew it out.."
Absolutely! Hope RBR protest this too.
"bye bye tata for now 🤣🥴

remember, more points = better!!! 🤪"
"God forbid I except one of the largest car manufacturers in the world to have the resources to make a half-decent engine, nice ad hominem by the way, really stooping to my level, cheers."
Yep and if Bottas drives better this year he'll have more points ;)
"What level? what magnificent level or single valid argument have you shown?

Honda have in the few years build an engine that can compete with the top of the grid and even gave max several race wins in their literal first season with red bull.

I don’t think you comprehend how utter nonsense you are spewing. Also don’t say Words you don’t understand the meaning of because someone used it against you at some point."
that’s exactly right!!!!  so let’s hope they use lewis to hold the others up this year & to take the risks on the ‘other’ strategy 😉🤓
"Look mate, just pull you up on the ""compete with the top of the grid"". When have they done that? They've only won races thanks to the aero not engine. Never in a title fight with honda. What in the fuck is your argument. Stop pretending to be so clever and wise."
"I don't have to go back and prove myself to you lmao, when your whole argument boils down to ""buuttttt buttt max won some racceessss with a Honda"", get a grip you are losing yourself."
You are trying awfully hard to prove yourself and to win an argument for someone that says he doesn’t have to prove himself. But I wouldn’t want to go back either if I have made such an embarrassment of myself. Have fun with the race.
Have fun with that world-class Honda engine being 10 seconds back lmao.
